australia,social media addiction teens Australia,Online Gaming Platforms And YouTube Will Also Seemingly Be Banned For Aussies Under 16,"There’s so much collateral damage in this plan for Australia to ban social media. This has been rushed and not thought through. 

So many schools rely on YouTube to support their students. 

Most kids are watching YouTube (or YouTube kids) more than ABC or traditional TV. Literally the biggest YouTube channel in Australia is original music for kids.

You won't ban gambling ads but will the thing that many young kids like to do with their mates for fun.

Parenting,social media age restriction Australia,Update: I found my daughter's (12f) horrific hidden social media account. Help!,"It's been a little over a week since my last post. The first thing I want to say is thank you so for your support. You all really helped me calm down and have me helpful tips to approach the situation. 

To answer the question of which app, it was YouTube. The videos themselves were taken suggestively, but she'd remained mostly clothed. The photos and written posts she shared were more graphic. 

What happened with the police: The first officer I spoke to was very helpful. The officer I spoke to when I arrived at the police department refused to make a report. He told me that if they didn't specifically ask her for sexual favors, no crime had been committed. He also said there was nothing he could do about her sharing her location.

Her school/friends: I can't recall the handles of the two people whose advice I followed, just know I genuinely appreciate it. I called the principal and told her I had found a hidden social media account. I then told her two people had been messaging my daughter outside of the app that concerned me. I told her school uniforms were shown in photos and told her the names of the students my daughter shared pictures and details of. She was surprised but told me she would handle it without going into details. The school has on duty police who have been monitoring the children more closely.

According to my daughter, they added some Internet safety classes during study periods as well. 

There have been no changes in her friend group. They all know the details my daughter chose to share with them. They talked about it for a day or so, but quickly moved on. 

What we choose to do for discipline: Many people reached out to me both in the comments and privately sharing their stories. Many had done the same thing my daughter had. Thank you for being brave enough to share your stories. 

These people told me how their parents responded and how that affected them. This helped me formulate my plan of action. 

One thing the comments on my post learned toward is that she was looking for attention. After speaking with her about this, I've dedicated two hours of one on one time with her each night. We've gone on walks, played board games, had long discussions and gone for walks. 

The only real punishment is that she lost her phone for a month. After reading the comments I felt giving her love and support was the best way to approach the situation. 

Therapy: We had our emergency appointment with her therapist last week. I told her about the post and specific comments that made me think, but I didn't know how to respond to them. She helped me work through this. She agrees that support is the way to handle the situation. My daughter has been able to clearly communicate what she did wrong and she's taking accountability.

One comment had asked wouldn't it have been better if I'd allowed her to have social media so I could monitor it and know what's happening. Especially since she went behind my back and the things I was most afraid of happening to her on social media happened. 

In discussing this with her therapist, we've decided that if she works toward regaining trust over the next six months we'll allow her to get an account. I will have access and be monitoring it for her safety. It will be private and restricted so only her friends can access it. 

We were supposed to meet with the therapist again today, which is why I've been waiting to update. We were going to go over some topics she'd wanted to sit with and consult with colleagues. Then she'd have a private conversation with my daughter. Unfortunately the therapist cancelled because she was sick. 

I'll update again if anything relevant happens after we visit with her therapist again.

Thank you all again for your support, advice and kind words. Those of you who pointed out mistakes I've made in my parenting are also appreciated. Those of you who shared your stories, I'm sorry that you went through that. I'm glad most of you've been able to heal. I think it's important you know you aren't alone and you didn't deserve the things that happened.

This surprisingly turned into something that really allowed me to bond with my girl. She's been more open with me and appreciative of the support she's getting, not just from me but other family members. Our support system really circled around her. She's expressed that she's grateful and sees how important she is to our family and how much we all love her.",3121,98,Content_Big903,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1kt3oes/update_i_found_my_daughters_12f_horrific_hidden/,2025-05-22 22:18:18,"Welcome to r/Parenting!

AskAnAustralian,age verification social media Australia,Any other Australians sick of American culture wars infecting our politics and society?,"This might speak to my age as an old man in my forties, but does anyone else feel like we've entered this bizarre post-reality socio-political era, where (as Rammstein prophesied) ""We all live in America""? I'm based in Queensland and currently doing my best to endure the local state election, and it feels like this strange, tribalistic microcosm of American culture war politics that's based more on Internet talking points than Australian reality.

Currently (or in the last few years) we've seen CPAC hosted in Australia, local political parties trying to roll back abortion rights using talking points drawn directly from the US Republican party, random people in your extended family or social circle becoming active and vocal supporters of Donald Trump (to the point where some portion of them are definitely on board with 'Democrat weather machine' conspiracies)  , Parliamentarians putting forward ""It's OK to be White"" bills, the Australian Christian Lobby calling queer people 'groomers' and jumping right aboard the GOP trans panic train, people like Candace Owens touring the country... it feels like there's just no escape from the influence of culture war nonsense.

Sure, we've always had racists and homophobes, but at least they were racists and homophobes drawing from an Australian experience and reflecting an Australian character. Now it just feels like they're regurgitating whatever happen to be the Republican talking points du jour.

I'm not saying leftists are immune from this either (even if it's usually in a less harmful or belligerent way): I regularly see people fawning over Kamala Harris or otherwise having a deep attachment to American Democratic policies, importing American euphemistic social justice language like 'houselessness' (a term not used by any major homelessness organisation in Australia), 'POC', etc that feels pretty alien from the way Australians with those experiences have historically described themselves; and drawing on anecdotes, policies and statistics around marginalisation that might be true in the USA, but aren't true in any Australian jurisdiction.

Every day, whether they actively try to engage with it or not (and regardless of their personal politics), the algorithm is serving up everyday Australians a great big serving of American culture war discourse. I know that the combination of social media, COVID and Trump has genuinely broken everyone's brain, and that we kind of just need to buckle up and accept the new reality, but is anyone else dismayed that conversations about the needs of Australian society is so heavily informed by this tribalistic, binary, reality-denying nonsense fueled by the spectacle of American media and online propaganda? Is there any coming back from this?",3072,680,Figshitter,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAustralian/comments/1g7xe20/any_other_australians_sick_of_american_culture/,2024-10-20 12:17:44,"I miss the days when I didn't know anything about American elections and didn't care.

australia,social media age restriction Australia,Why can't we normalise wearing masks when we're sick?,"With more respiratory illness occurring due to winter, why can't we normalise wearing masks when we're sick here in Australia as people do in East Asia? I find it utterly bizarre that we don't adopt this approach when it seems to make a lot more sense from a collective-health perspective. 

Taking public transport to work every day means I come across folks who are visibly ill very frequently. Given that we can't avoid the fact we live in a capitalist world that necessitates earning money to survive, I understand that some people—especially those on casual contracts—have no choice but to jump on the train, tram, or bus to get to work with whatever infection they're carrying. 

I also understand that an enormous proportion of the Australian public hated mask mandates and saw them as an attack on social liberties. 

So in all seriousness, what gives? Why can't we change the conversation to wearing a mask when we're sick? 

It seems like a total no-brainer that would help to protect the community.",2403,571,kafka99,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1kzmaul/why_cant_we_normalise_wearing_masks_when_were_sick/,2025-05-31 02:27:11,"This post has been marked as non-political.

I wore a mask on Thursday because I had a head cold and one of my co-workers has a parent in hospital in intensive care and another has an immuno-compromised kid.

I had four or five people from other areas on the floor stop me and ask if I had COVID, who mostly then looked at me like I was being a weirdo or drama-queen when I said no, but I didn't want to spread my cold. A couple of them were definitely seemed like they were ""offended"" by the mask, but in fairness a couple of others also said that made sense etc. whatever. People have a lot of residual weirdness/angst about that whole period, so I get some would feel a reaction, but as you say, it should just be common courtesy.

Parenting,young people and social media ban,My child might be trans and I'm not okay ,"Throwaway acct. 

I know I will be flamed for this post in a place like reddit, so really hoping for some understanding takes. I don't need hate saying I'm phobic, bigoted, don't accept my child and will lose them etc etc. Trust me I've agonized about all that enough in my own head. 

My 15 yo son came out as bi a year ago which we were good with and accepted. 
However now he told me he is trans. And that was a whole different thing and I am not okay.

He has *never* shown signs of being into anything remotely girly or feminine. He is a quirky, profoundly gifted kid potentially on the spectrum (not found in evaluation but I think because of how high functioning he is). Your typical sort of nerdy gamer kid in his interests, never cared about his appearance, clothes anything not even to the extent that most boys his age do - never mind the extent most girls go through. As in still needs to be reminded to comb his hair and wear deodorant most days. Always seemed fine living as a boy, playing with 'boy toys', made mainly boy friends at school. 

And yes, I know you can ""be a woman"" and not do any of those things bla bla. But, it just totally seemed to have come out of nowhere, and even he said that he never really had dysphoria, and claims that you don't need to have dysphoria to be trans. That it's enough to just know that you are. I asked him what he thinks will make him happier about living as a woman than a man and he had no answers besides that he thinks ""he will like it better that way"".

One thing that has been going on for a few years is he is definitely a bit 'chronically online', which we thought was okay due to his niche interests, he claims to have a long term group of online friends on discord and is part of a gaming community which just happened to have a very big percentage of LGBT folk. He has resisted our urging to hang out more with real life friends in person tho he has some in school he isn't interested in hanging out afterwards. And of course the online community is where he says he has gone to seek information and their experiences and it all convinced him that he is what he is. 

I can't help but feel that at his age most typical teens are having those formative social experiences like hanging out, friend groups, dating, that are giving them excitement and dopamine and feeling of belonging, and he is missing that and is trying to fill that gap with something else without realizing it. He has an anxiety diagnosis as well and have had some concerning behavior phases as a younger child (ocd behavior, intense meltdowns etc). He says none of that is in no way related to gender identity but I'm not so sure it's not all part of the same bigger picture. 

My issue is he has always been very rigid, inflexible, and hyperfocused. When he has a project or interest he dives headfirst into it. And here transition is such a huge long term projects with so many steps, that I just feel like he will get caught up in all the details of it versus trying to truly understand his own identity and how this will affect his life. I have tried to urge him to step away from the online spaces and really just explore himself from the perspective of himself and no one else. 

To be clear none of this is about me or gender. I dgaf what he identifies as, in fact I always wanted a daughter. I would have loved nothing more than to be all accepting about it and be excited about going shopping together or whatnot.

But I cannot bring myself to do that because I know it's not as easy as flipping a switch and the world sees him as a woman. I know he is choosing a path that is going to be laden with so much hate, discrimination, health risks (even as a woman, I have always avoided hormones like even the birth control pill wreaked havoc on my body. I cannot even begin to imagine the effect of mega doses of hormone therapy your biological body was never designed for, and I believe we don't yet have the populations and research to truly know what sort of risks it carries down the road). Especially with the current political climate, he would be throwing himself right in the middle of such a heated hate filled topic. 

Myself and my husband are both from immigrant families too, from a country where we have known what it's like to need to be cautious and to sometimes need to hide who you are to survive. We aren't activists, risk takers, the whole stand up proud and speak up type of people - that not us or our parents or their parents, we have always been the keep your head down, work hard, and protect your family's safety and well being at all costs. Safety has literally been our number one priority for everyone always - maximum safety, not just ""live in a liberal community and hope for the best"" type safety. 

Our kids don't know all that, they've grown up with all the advantages and privileges we could give them - affluent upper middle class upbringing, a safe friendly community, the best schools, all the educational opportunities. They never experienced bullying at school, they've always felt safe and accepted everywhere they go; and we've worked so hard to pave the road ahead of them to as good a future as possible. And now, he is basically preparing to throw it all away, and to become a marginalized member of society, an outcast in the eyes of so many. He is placing a giant concrete wall of a roadblock in the middle of that path we've worked so hard to place for him. He is absolutely brilliant, he is effortlessly objectively handsome - I'm betting girls (or boys) would start swiveling their heads at him very soon if they aren't already, despite him showing very little interest in dating so far. He literally has so much going for him - and to throw it all away and replace it with an existence where his dating and career opportunities will shrink down to a miniscule sliver of what they could be; where he will be hated by some just for being out at a public space, where he could get harassed, beat up, fucking killed just walking down the street. I am so scared this will destroy his life if not prematurely end it - and what if this is not even something that he truly needs to do, but a product of his neurodiversity, anxiety, and outside influences?? I am absolutely terrified for him and I have been bursting into private crying fits on and off since we've talked. Again this isn't about actual gender. This is about all these other things. It feels like when you hold your two year old's hand when crossing the street and teach them to cross safely as they get older - only for them to announce that once they're of age, they plan to spend every day standing in the middle of a highway and just hope they won't get run over but it's worth it cause they might be happier that way. It's like that and every one of my parental instincts is screaming out in protest and fear. 

I have explained all this to him and he understands some points but he is still absolutely adamant that as soon as he is able he will start looking into medical transitioning with or without our support. I have begged him to give it a bit more time before making up his mind - just asking that he keep his options open, that he distance himself a bit from his online interaction and try having some real life experiences, friends, dating, jobs, before convincing himself 100%  that he needs to do this. He is still so so young and hasn't really lived life and I don't understand how you can make such major decisions without living first in a more matured mind and body and having these life experiences. It's just scary to me how he seems so adamant on it, to where I feel he won't let himself entertain the thoughts of not going through with it just out of principle, and I'm terrified of him making a lifelong mistake and ruining his life.
That's not even touching the topic of how devastated our extended families will be and no it's not about them not being accepting, they're from a different culture and background but their kids and grandkids are their whole lives, my parents have been so selfless and loving all my life they adore our kids so much, and I know they will love him no matter what but I know it will destroy them.

I don't need warm and fuzzy sentiments of oh maybe it'll all work out and he'll find his people etc etc. cause we all know the world is not warm and fuzzy. Life is harsh enough and you can only make it easier or harder for yourself and stack your deck. If it were all rainbows and butterflies, there wouldn't so much suffering in the world but here we are. 

If this is indeed who he is and after maturing fully and finding his people, friend, dating, starting a career, he still wants to go through with it - we will be supportive. But as of right now, I don't feel I can support him in something that could destroy his future and I don't feel his prefrontal cortex is mature enough to make such decisions. I just want him to understand nothing should be set in stone right now, just to keep his mind and options open for the next few years, but it scares me that he is not open to that notion at all. 

Any advice, support, resources welcome. I would love to see resources I could let him read that provide a more balanced view. I feel that all the information provided by the LGBT community is somewhat of an echo chamber - your decision is always the right one, this is who you are, everyone needs to support you otherwise they're toxic and hateful and you need to cut them out. It is very unbalanced, and the truth is that this is much more nuanced, and people who have indeed changed their minds or regretted their decision are probably not well represented in such spaces. 

My child's entire future feels like it's crumbling before my eyes and I can't deal. ",1843,91,Particular_Local4190,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1htlzum/my_child_might_be_trans_and_im_not_okay/,2025-01-04 19:20:32,"I think that kids your sons age are trying to figure out their sexuality, they're trying to figure out themselves and these (relatively) new urges that they have, they're trying to figure out where they fit into the world, and they're trying to find a group to belong to.  I think those things can cause some kids who aren't really trans to decide ""you know, this feels right to me, I think this is my place in the world"" for awhile.  In short, it's a phase.  Not always of course, but for some kids.  Whether that's the case for your son I don't know.

Whether your son is genuinely trans or not I think the next step is the same.  Find a therapist.  If he genuinely is trans that's who will be able to help him start making a plan to transition.  And if it is just a phase the therapist will help him work through those feelings and realize that medically transitioning isn't right for him.  I definitely wouldn't try to talk him out of anything.  He's pretty much at the peak rebelliousness age.  Trying to convince him it's just a phase is going to lead to him pushing back harder than he would if you are outwardly supportive.

As someone with a trans child, who had a hard time of it internally, here is my advice:

1) Accept that it might be real and it might be a phase. It could be either, so accept that and let it unfold. Fighting it will not benefit you or your child. It will only cause their feelings to become further entrenched. Trying to force your child from friends will only make those friends more attractive. Same with activities.


2) Accept your child. Period. No conditions. If your child wants to be called them, do it. If your child wants to be called him or her, do it. This sends a message to your children that they are safe to explore and they are accepted by their parents no matter what. Accept them no matter what. Make yourself safe to your child. Allow your child to feel safe telling you how they feel. Express that they are safe.


3) Get your child therapy. It will help your child figure themselves out and understand themselves. Either they will be able to come to terms with who they are and navigate the difficulties of being trans, or they will learn about boundaries and not be who their friends want them to be. But either way, it will help them.


4) Get yourself therapy. You need to process this without it affecting your child. Accepting that your child is not who you planned them to be takes work. Do the work. 


5) Read. Learn about what it means to be trans and how to be a parent to a trans child. There is a lot of material out there. Take advantage of that.


6) If your child comes out to you, seek out help from your local gender clinic. They have resources to help your child and you. It is not necessarily about hormones or surgery (and may never be). It will be helpful for mental health.


Please feel free to contact me if you need more support.

Hi there! Trans person here! 

Listen, you are right that this may be hard for your kid. I get that you are scared for them, that makes total sense - the world is a little scary for us right now. I get that this is a lot for you to adjust to, and that it can be hard to accept this new identity when it seems to have come out of nowhere. 

But - you are going to be ok. You are a good parent. I can tell because your kid felt safe enough to come out to you. Your kid is processing a lot of big identity stuff and they told you about it, even though they are a teenager and naturally separating from you in a lot of ways. 

So take a deep breath and give yourself a hug. Your teen trusts you with this and that is huge. 

Now just support them. They might be trans, they might not. Being a teenager is about figuring yourself out. But you lose nothing by just believing them right now. If they change their mind later that is ok. Just be there for them and listen. Don’t try to talk them out of anything, just listen and see where they are coming from. 

Trans youth face a high risk of suicide - and that risk is more than cut in half when they have a supportive parent. 

Being trans is not a choice. But telling you was a choice. Please make the choice to support your kid in return.",2025-01-04 19:20:32,True
Parenting,young people and social media ban,Bring back the home phone so children can make phone calls....,"When I was a kid in the 80's, everyone had a home phone and kids would call each other.  We had a list of family and friends numbers next to the phone.  I feel that is part of why kids start asking for phones so young is because they have no way to contact their friends & family without asking to use their parent's cellphone.  My brother had a home phone all along and my nephew would call me and other family members from it often starting when he was as young as 5 years old......

Elementary school age we were phoning our friends to make plans to go to each others houses.  Junior high we were calling each other to meet up on our bikes in the neighborhood.  High school we would call each other to decide where we are meeting up to go out or hang at one persons house.

My home phone was a 5 dollar add on to my internet and runs through my modem.  It's not a true landline but that doesn't matter, what matters to me is having a corded phone to talk on at home.

Not a portable phone though.........a corded phone that stays in it's place or a flip/smart phone that stays in a certain spot in the house as people here suggested.  The home phone by definition belongs to the household and not to any individual.

It's also relevant for emergencies......growing up, every kid knew how to dial 911 which is a lot simpler in an emergency than finding mom or dad's cellphone which may have a password protect.  For emergencies, a phone with physical buttons and no barriers is ideal.

Home phone culture also fostered social skills because when you called someone's house, you had to say hello to whoever answered and ask for the person you are calling for.  You may even end up talking for a minute with the mom or the brother or sister of whomever you were calling before they passed the phone on to the person you called for.",1790,223,Reasonable_Yard_3300,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1k3b6f5/bring_back_the_home_phone_so_children_can_make/,2025-04-20 01:10:23,"We have a flip phone velcroed to the fridge as a ""home phone"".

You can still get a landline. Service is around $25 / month (even cheaper abroad). A cheap corded telephone can be bought at Best Buy for $20. While many people have completely moved over to cellphones, you can still do the old school land line. The tech isn't extinct. 

In fact, having a landline is a very good idea for emergency situations when cell service could go down.

Parenting,young people and social media ban,10 y/o received serious awful texts - the school asking how we want to proceed,"Hope this is the right forum for this topic... My 10 year old 5th grader was acting strange lately and has told us she wanted to talk about some things at school but only mentioned that a ""friend"" of hers told my daughter was annoying and she didn't want to be friends any longer. No biggie and we helped her through that...

The issue is we took our daughter's phone (not looking for judgment on her age having a phone) and found the most disturbing text message group chats. One of her ""friends"" started a group chat called ""'xyz' Haters"" which included a large group of her school ""friends"" taking turns roasting her - then they added my daughter to the chat so she could see what people were saying. The things said about her were so awful and included some texts saying she should kill herself. It was so painful to see this and try to get her to understand these arent friends and this stuff is not true etc. The thread was so long with so many terrible things said about her - to her.

We reached out to some of the moms and provided screenshots of the text thread so they could see the things their children were saying. We got a lot of positive response and most parents were receptive. We never heard back from the ""friends"" mom who started the chat (and said things about death) although know she saw it bc my daughter received a ""sorry"" text from that friend.

We brought this to the school bc we thought it needed to be addressed at that level and that no other kids have to go through this. The school is supportive and has told us that the things said in that group chat go ""way beyond even harassment"" and asked us if we wanted this escalated by them bringing in a youth resource officer to explain the implications of their words. My wife is worried that my daughter will have to go face these kids now at school and then enter into middle school with them next year.

Should we allow the school to escalate this to a resource officer or ask them to just monitor the issue knowing the situation? Looking for guidance on the right thing to do, our daughter wants us to just drop it but the school wants to really escalate this - we don't want our daughter to be put in a more difficult position in school by escalating this but also feel there needs to be accountability on behalf of the children who participated

EDIT:: fwiw she has zero social media and we lock down most of her phone and monitor - she only has texting, mainly so we can get ahold of her when we need. Thought that it would be okay for her to be able to text friends too but, here we are...

EDIT:: thank you all for the amazing support, it may be a no-brianer for some but balancing the future trust with our daughter and navigating potential retaliation/ostracization makes us second guess the right path forward. We met with the principal today and are escalating it. We also made a point to tell them at the minimum we expect that the outcome from the school is consistent with school policy. We will stay on top of this until we feel comfortable with the outcome and have asked that they assist us in getting her into an option school.

UPDATE: From the Principal today: ""Thank you for your email. I understand and share your concern as I was appalled at what I read on that text thread. It may be the worse that I've read at the elementary level, and it needs to absolutely be addressed.Although this happened outside of school on student owned devices, there is a nexus to school since it may cause disruption, worry, or fear to the school environment. Therefore, we are obligated to investigate and respond. I understand that XXX is worried about breaking the trust between XXX and you as parents, and so we will try and be as discreet as possible as we investigate, but there is a chance that all of this is going to come out as well. I just want you to be aware of that.As part of the investigation, we first and foremost safety plan to make sure that XXX feels safe while at school. This includes going through her day and having her identify times/places where she may feel unsafe or vulnerable. Next, we will gather as much information from interviewing XXX and the other students.After our initial investigation, I will involve our Youth Resource Officer, because this offense may surpass the school level. Given that there could be a crime involved, we are obligated to turn it over to them to make sure they have it documented and that they complete a further investigation if necessary. At that point, we will follow the School Student and Family Handbook and consequences will be assigned as appropriate.As a parent, you always have the right to file your own police report, especially since this happened on student-owned devices outside of school. You can call the non-emergency number to do so, and they will follow their protocol.""

We are really impressed with how serious the school has taken this.

UPDATE 2: Our daughter really wants us to stop talking about this. The school is doing an ""investigation"" before they turn it over to SRO and make discipline decisions. Of course in the meantime today the group came up to her at recess and told her that she was no longer their friend - as if that wasn't already obvious. ugh. sucks so bad for her. shes trying to be strong but you can tell it just hurts so bad.

I don’t want to get overly technical but fuck those kids and, yes, escalate it.

There's a school in my state being sued by the parents of a girl who did kill herself after a campaign of harassment like this.

The parents claim the school did nothing and swept it under the rug. 

I'd take them up on their offer to escalate it and be glad they're willing to be proactive rather than chalking it up to ""kids being kids"".
---
Let the school escalate it. That kind of behavior needs to be halted, with whatever punishments the resource officer deems necessary.
---
I would just like too add, if you choose to go against your daughter's wishes to ""just drop it"" (and i believe you should push this for the record) make sure you're sitting her down and explaining what you're planning on doing and what it'll look like moving forward and WHY it is important to push this. Teaching children to defend themselves is important. I struggle with this in my adult life now, becuase I didn't learn this skill in childhood. 

I am very confident she will say something like ""pushing this will make things worse for her"" or ""no one will want to be her friend"" and it's vital she understands that this won't stop at all unless it's forced and they see there are consequences for such terrible behavior. And these people were never her friends because friends don't treat others this way. 

Also also, i know you didn't want phone comments but if I may just suggest a ""no phone when you're home"" policy? If she's getting picked on at school and then comes home and gets it on her phone too she gets zero decompression time. It's probably very taxing on her.

privacy,Albanese social media ban,"How easily the general public folded for RedNote after TikTok, we're truly alone in the fight for privacy","The general public doesn't care. They just don't.

We will always be alone. Even though we're fighting for all of us. Because we're ""criminals"", we ""have something to hide"", we're ""doing stuff we shouldn't"", we ""don't think about the children or terrorists"", the list goes on and on.

We're the bad guys.

Not the for-profit corporations out to harvest every little detail of you, tracking every second of your life, wherever and whenever, but us. We're the issue.

The issue isn't China, it isn't Russia, it isn't the US, it isn't the UK. The:

""Oh but the US does the same, why does everyone have a hard on for China and TikTok?""

argument isn't valid. Because it's masking the real issue.

They're **ALL** out for us. Doesn't matter if it's domestic or foreign. They all do the same thing. The issue is the public just does not care.

I'm so sad but also incredibly scared by how easily the public folded after the TikTok news. This means we're truly the outliers.

You have 16 year old suburban kids trying to speak Mandarin on that platform now. It's horrific. All so they can keep engaged and monetized and advertised to. 

The companies brainwashed everyone so they fight their fellow brothers and sisters instead of see who the real enemies are. They'll label us weirdos for not using social media, or even if we use it, for not using it in a specific way. The companies got the people doing their work for them, for free. The biggest, most successful propaganda in the history of mankind, social media.

Just my little rant. I'm honestly a little scared. The future isn't looking bright.

**Edit:** I keep seeing more and more new comments remarking on my ""16 year old suburban kids trying to speak Mandarin"" part of my post, as if it's some sort of gotcha! moment and I'm racist. So I'm pasting my response below to anyone else wanting to make that same comment which **completely** misses my point.

> You're missing the point. They're not learning Mandarin to learn a new language or better themselves. They're learning it so they can keep using a social media app, that's the horrific part.

> The masses got addicted to it. So much so that they'll try and learn a whole new language, just so they can keep engaged, post their little dances and recreate the most recent trend.

> Yeah, one might say ""Who cares why they're learning it? At least they are."" but that's not the point. The point is the reliance and dependence on social media to function as a person in modern society. People shouldn't be like this.

> I promise you, if McDonalds pulled out of the US market tomorrow. People would just move to Burger King, they wouldn't go to Mexico or Canada just to get McDonalds. That's the same thing with TikTok = RedNote and learning Mandarin. But when it comes to social media, people will literally learn a whole new language.

> It's mostly teens too. Which sets a bad precedent for our future politicians. These are the kids who'll go out and vote (or not vote, which is equally worse) on privacy legislations when you and I are old af. They'll vote on the basis of ""I have nothing to hide so I don't really care about this issue, they can take my rights away, I don't care"" which is something you do not want!

> So the Mandarin issue goes deeper than that. The issue isn't that they're learning Mandarin, but WHY they're learning Mandarin. That's the horrific part.

> We're well and truly doomed.

The average Joe in 2025 will label Snowden a traitor, not use Linux Mint, not turn off Location on their phone, but will go out of their way to learn Mandarin as soon as their favorite social media app is banned. That's the horrific part...

Social media is currently filled with ""My Chinese spy waiting for me to learn Mandarin so we can be together again and he can recommend me more videos"" memes. The same kind of memes as ""My FBI Agent watching me through my webcam play World of Warcraft for 16 hours straight"". This is normalizing the privacy violating behavior of corporations and governments. It doesn't really matter if it's the US or China. As when these kids who make these memes grow up, they'll grow up thinking these things are normal, and one day they'll be of voting age, and completely give away every one's rights by voting (or not voting) against their common interests. Some of you are really missing the point big on this discussion.

**Edit 2:** And yes, maybe this wasn't apparent from my post. But I fully agree with the fact that no platform should be banned. Not even TikTok. It's hypocrisy from the US governments part. And I also agree with the general sentiment and protests, like saying a big F you and giving the middle finger to the government, purposefully using RedNote. But I'm also of the opinion that, leaving the table is the best action.

""The only winning move is to not play""

Kind of opinion. Rather than use yet another social media app, this should be the moment people ask themselves ""Do I really need these apps in the first place? Am I using them, or are they using me? What do I actually benefit from using these apps?"" and reflect on their usage of social media apps.

The post got turned into an US vs China discussion, which was never my intention. My point was about peoples reliance on social media, and how easily they can fold and be influenced. That's the issue.

They're both horrible. Leave the game. Take back control. Realize you don't need these apps to function.",1354,532,JohnSmith---,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1i3c4pw/how_easily_the_general_public_folded_for_rednote/,2025-01-17 08:47:11,"[With the utmost respect to this sub’s community]

People are simply tired and apathy has fully set in. They no longer trust the companies they were once told they could rely on, because time and again those companies have shown they don’t truly care about customers’ and users’ data. Whether it’s failing to put proper safeguards in place (leading to breaches) or blatantly selling and trading data with third parties, these organizations have undermined public confidence.

As a result, many people feel their information is already “out there,” so urging them to protect it seems pointless. Growing distrust in the government only adds to this sense of resignation. In their view, they have nothing left to lose. They’re not all cybersecurity experts or analysts; they don’t see the risks we deal with day in and day out, and they’re certainly not privacy wonks. For them, it’s just another reason to tune out and give up on the idea of real data protection.

I don’t have any answers, and this is just one person‘s opinion, but, yeah.
---
People would love to care, I think it’s unfair to frame the issue this way. The problem is people know all their info and countless hours of their browsing data has already been bought, sold, and stolen countless times, in some cases including by China. How can you expect people to care when they receive mail at least once a year telling them about a data breach at some company they didn’t even know had it? When they have evidence of their phones listening to them despite companies denying it? When the personal info of *every person who’s ever filled out an SF86* was stolen by China due to the government’s shitty cybersecurity infrastructure?

People are tired. They feel privacy is an outdated concept, and honestly they’re probably right. Our government has shown people that our data security isn’t a priority, they have done *nothing* to protect us in that regard, but they expect us to take it seriously?
---
The use of rednote is in protest against banning tiktok. It's not because they're sending data to the chinese on purpose, although that may well also be the case here. 
---
There's a certain irony to people flocking to an app that is - allegedly - more closely linked with the Chinese government than TikTok, in order to avoid a theoretical ban based on TikTok allegedly being too close to the Chinese government.

australia,social media age restriction Australia,I want to warn renters that your perfect tenancy record will be useless once your lease is no longer renewed. And you'll probably become--and remain--homeless if your income is less than $1500 per fortnight.,"I was an ideal tenant, but still became homeless. I've been homeless for over two months. I'm writing about my experience, but sharing an abridged draft here because a) the housing crisis will worsen, and b) if you're under the poverty line you will probably become homeless too (because >95% of listings are already >60% of your income **\[\*1\]**). I want warn you that--regardless your spotless tenancy record--you too are disposable in this greed-fuelled rental crisis.

&#x200B;

**\[\*1\]** Real estate agencies (REAs) call 60% of your fortnightly income the ""sweet spot"" for rent. Then they encourage the owner to increase the rent as much as state legislature allows. You'll pay the first two increases (probably 66% and 72.6% of your income, respectively) because tenants are desperate to avoid homelessness. But once vacated, the property can be relisted with an increase unrestricted by legislation.

&#x200B;

You could be the most reliable tenant your REA has, but you'll still be homeless if you're living below the poverty line. If you can't outbid the other applicants, your application will sit alongside peoples' who moved furniture across the floor without sliders, who parked on the lawn, and who flushed hygiene wipes down the toilet. Your ""Tenant of the Month"" certificate is worthless, because a good tenancy history is irrelevant in these market conditions.

&#x200B;

Twenty years ago, a homeowner invested in a second home with the intention of selling it after a couple decades of appreciation. A reliable renter was desired because we maintained the property, and our rent payments contributed to the mortgage--but we weren't expected to cover the entire mortgage, council rates, REA fees, etc. Today's property investors have different expectations.

…

&#x200B;

After she sold unit I was renting, the agent assured me that I'd been such a good tenant that the REA would ""want to hold on to \[me\]."" A lie; I was disposable **\[\*2\]**. You will be too, because REAs don't need to ""hold on to"" good tenants when they have an oversupply of desperate tenants. The REA's priority is to maximise their income from collected rents.

&#x200B;

**\[\*2\]** The week after I became homeless, the REA listed a neighbour's unit--in the same complex, for the same rent--and never give me a head's up, nor a chance to apply before the inspections were fully booked. So the homeowner never knew that a tenant was prepared to pay rent immediately; that the homeowner needn't forego a month of rent in order to list the property, run inspections, and process applicants. I was a tenant with neither pets, nor kids, and with a clean tenancy history of twenty years--the last four years with that REA. A tenant with almost a hundred inspections under her belt, after which the agent wrote ""thank you for a lovely inspection!"" on the report.

&#x200B;

How good a tenant was I? Well, the contractor who installed the air conditioner didn't connect the drainpipe. So I exited the shower to find a different shower happening in the dining room. Me and my hair dryer worked two hours to protect the owner's property from rot or warping…no easy task if linoleum warps when you hold the dryer on one spot too long. The hot air kept bouncing back and burning my face, burning my eyes. Plus, it was an east-facing brick wall, and a 39 degree day; I became violently sick. This wasn't even the month I won ""Tenant of the Month."" I'd want a tenant like me.

…

&#x200B;

Three months before the lease expired, I was already applying to places that would keep me close to my ailing father. 60% of my income was approximately $330 per week, but the median for a one bedroom place hovered around $350 per week. I could afford that--I was desperate enough to live on rice in order to afford it--but the problem (for me and you) is that *REAs have their eyes on the rental horizon…on how high rents can go*. It's not enough that the potential tenant can afford the advertised rent…they must be able the afford *what the rent will be*. This is why you'll probably become homeless if your income is <$1500 per fortnight, and your current lease isn't renewed.

&#x200B;

I mentioned that REAs expect rents to continue rising by 10% every six months for the indefinite future **\[\*1\]** . This 10% ""potential"" is an ersatz policy in the state's RE industry since covid restrictions were eased. They encourage the homeowner to raise the rent every six months--by the legal maximum for a tenanted property--then email the tenant that the rent was increased owing to ""market conditions"". This policy has been successfully, steadily, contributing to the rent rises for the past three years. Most politicians have investment properties and thus are invested in amplifying the crisis. Immigration replaces people who are ""priced out"" of the market, keeping the rent rise going. Australia will soon have a class of ""working homeless"", just like the USA.

…

&#x200B;

It's been almost six months since I began applying. After last week's welfare increase, I can now apply for $350 p/w listings. But over the last six months, the median for a one bedroom has risen from around $350p/w, to around $400p/w. In mid-September I joined the waiting list for public housing. But that's a pipedream. Every month, more families join the waiting list for social housing. I--who made the agonising choice not to bring a child into my circumstances--will be knocked further and further down the list because parents get priority.

&#x200B;

I'm constantly sick from stress, and crying in my car. I spend all day at university. I couch-surf at night. I can't adequately describe my despair. I've seen squalid places, and applied to places dangerous for a single woman. Details from my applications have been used to phish for my passwords; they tricked me with a personalised email ""from my university"" (thank god for multi-factor identification). I've lost my cherished books, my inherited mementos, most of my clothes and accessories.

&#x200B;

This is a small fraction of what I've experienced, and have learned, these last six months. I just needed to share this here, because I can't imagine I'll finish the unabridged version and so many people don't know how hopeless their circumstances will become.

&#x200B;

I am so sorry this has happened to you. I am terrified of it happening to me. Renting just sucks so much.

The whole process is shit. Literally every part of the process is focused on maximising monetary gain, as opposed to being a balance between monetary gain and getting people into homes.
It’s actually quite disgusting we’ve let it get this bad, but imo Australians are always very keen to line their pockets and jump on lucrative opportunities, even when it’s at the expense of the community they reside in.
A major overhaul is needed to re-balance the owner/renter system, even basic temporary measures like rent freezes or caps aren’t implemented. 
A major overhaul will never occur because people are simply too selfish to give up a cent of even potential income and only a third of the population rent.
Ultimately, without taking drastic steps to address this crisis Australia will devolve into a dual class society within 10-20 years, renters and owners. Every trend points towards this.

Parenting,young people and social media ban,I’m ashamed of how I raised my kid,"I love my son but I failed hardcore in raising him and he is turning out to be a real trashy loser type guy. He is 16, he barely passes his classes, he's always getting in trouble, he's a stoner, he has the worst manners and he's just every stereotype of an obnoxious loser teen. I am ashamed to bring him around my middle class friends and I'm embarassed by him at most school events. I hate that I feel this way about my kid and I know it's my fault for not having boundaries for him when he was young and pretty much just letting him do whatever he wanted and letting him run feral thinking I was being a ""free range parent"". I was just being lazy. And I've completely ruined my son.

We've been through TONS of therapy the last 4 years because he was getting in fights at school and overdosed on Benadryl and Twisted Ice Teas that he shoplifted from our local grocery store because he wanted to ""see the hat man"" (classy). I have been trying to correct course and be a better mom to my son, but it's been very difficult to get him to see the value in not being stoned all the time and behaving just a little less like trailer trash. He does have two hobbies I think could be very positive, playing guitar and skateboarding, and I really try to encourage him in those areas, but he seems to pull away from anything I encourage him in. 

Over the past year his dad and I have scrimped and saved to send him on two school trips, a trip with his band to march in the Saint Patrick's Day Parade in Ireland, and a student exchange trip to Germany. I have had to push him into these things, he said he didn't want to do them. Honestly I assumed it was because he would have to spend several weeks not getting high and vaping, and I wanted to encourage him to step out of his comfort zone and see some of the world. This might be the only chance he ever gets to travel internationally, we are working class people and travel is not a thing we get to do. 

The student he is supposed to exchange with has been here staying with us the past two weeks and I'm embarrassed about how rudely he has treated her. He barely talks to her, he never hangs out with her, this poor girl has to hang out with his parents and little siblings her whole trip. Today there was a field trip to our state capitol and while there some protest was happening and he basically yelled ACAB at some cops, in a somewhat more offensive way, and got in trouble. Then he got caught vaping at the art museum. His German teacher said he can't go to Germany now because he's a liability. My son honestly seems happy about it. Like he did it on purpose. I guess I shouldn't have pushed him into it, I guess I deserve this. I'm so incredibly ashamed my kid is the white trash kid who gets kicked out of the exchange program. I know how people talk about kids like him and what they say about the people who raise kids like this. But I would also be mortified to send him to stay with a family in Germany if he's going to behave this way there. 

I don't know, I feel like he needs some consequences for this, and obviously not going to Germany isn't a consequence for him. It's a reward. But it's hard not to feel like there's no point anymore. I don't want to give up on him, I'm not going to. But I don't know what else to do with him. I guess at least we will save $2500 not sending him on this trip. Maybe we can put that towards saving to send our younger kids on school trips eventually. 

Edit to answer some questions:

First of all, I want to thank everyone who came in here and said even worse things about me and my son than what I was feeling in the middle of being upset last night. It actually puts things in perspective for me and helps me remember that my son and I could actually be waaaaaayyyy worse people. Thank you.

So, many of you correctly identified that there is more to this story. Of course there is. I'm not trying to write a novel about our lives on Reddit. I was venting anonymously online, precisely so that I wouldn't lose my shit and say these things to my kid. I told him that I was disappointed, that I love him, and that I needed to talk to my therapist and his German teacher before we discussed this further. I don't want to say something I will regret saying. I also told him that he can't go to the concert he has tickets for next week.

He gets money for vapes and weed by having a job. Before he had the job, he had an $8 a week allowance, but mostly he got money for this stuff by stealing things and selling them.

His grades are actually not too bad. He has a C average. He's really pulled them up since Freshman year, actually. Thank you to everyone who has given me perspective on this.

We are both in therapy. Our insurance won't cover family therapy, but he was approved for an intensive outpatient program for substance abuse after the Benadryl incident, and we did about a year of family therapy through that which was very helpful. He and I both see individual therapists, and we are getting family therapy for our daughter right now which has been paid for by the crime victim's compensation fund because she was the victim of a crime earlier this year (which is a whole other story), but in that therapy we are working on learning to set better boundaries for all of my kids, which has been very helpful as well.

He has been diagnosed with ADHD and depression, but medicating him is difficult. First off, he just won't take the meds. We have tried several anti depressants and ADHD meds and he'll take the sporadically for a week or two, declare they don't do anything, then stop taking them. He also has a history of selling stolen medications to get money for things like vapes and weed. We have worked around this by me tightly controlling all the meds in the house, but that doesn't help with his refusal to take the pills. Every 9 months or so we repeat this process, he asks to get back on meds. I take him to the doctor, we go through the whole routines, he takes them for a few weeks, he quits because he says they don't do anything. I can't make him take meds, but he is very receptive to therapy and goes every other week.

As far as consequences go, I am very aware that I'm not good at setting them. He does not have his license because of the drug use. So I've done that. 

He and I are actually very close. I almost think that's a problem. He treats me like a friend, not a parent. He expects to be treated like a roommate, not a child. I know him very well. Closeness is not the issue. The fact that we don't have a parent/child relationship is. 

What do I wish I had done differently? This could be a novel, but I'll try to sum it up

1. For the first four years of his life I was a single mom and we lived with my mom, who has mental health issues. When I got married to my husband (who adopted my son) and moved in with him, he had a really hard time with the transition. I thought it would help if I let him spend a lot of weekends with his Grammy. She would want to take him pretty much every weekend, and I have no boundaries with her either so I let her. At her house he had zero rules, he could watch tv all day, eat candy all day, she bought him whatever he wanted whenever, then he would come home and throw fits and tell us he hated us. In retrospect, I suspect my mom (who was bitter that I got married and moved away from her) was venting her anger at me to him. My mom did the same thing to me, but about my dad. Ruined my relationship with my dad. Anyway, I'll never know for sure. This could be a whole novel, but I have always felt my mom stole my son from me. It was a terrible mistake to have him spend so much time with his Grammy, either way. He couldn't feel like he was part of our family if he wasn't spending time with us. If I could change only one thing, this would be it.

2. Less screen time, for both him and us. If we had spent less time in front of screens, we could have spent more time with him.

3. Better boundaries with all the grandparents, who all wanted to spoil him and he was the only grandchild for many years on both sides and he was just lavished with stuff and never told no by anyone. My husband and I never wanted him (or any of our kids) to have tablets or phones or all the video game consoles, but both of our parents wanted to give them these things and we didn't know how to say no to our parents. Boundaries are not just things you need with your kids, it turns out.

4. This one wasn't really a poor choice on our part, but I wish we had had the money for extra curriculars when he was younger. Sports or music lessons or scouts or something. We actually did try putting him in scouts and 4H but he hated them both, actually. By the time we were starting to be able to afford these things, all that money was going into therapy. Now we could theoretically afford therapy and activities, but he won't do any. I guess me forcing him into this exchange program was me trying to force him into one he shows interest in. He likes German class. But forcing him clearly wasn't a good idea.

5. I wish we would have taken him camping more. And on more bike rides. And hikes. I wish I had drug him to more of the community activities I do. I just wish I had spent more time with him, and made him do things that were good for him when he just wanted to play video games. Even if he complained the whole time. Even if he threw fits in public. I wish I had worried less about people who don't want to be ""bothered"" by children in public spaces, because not taking kids out in public spaces is a recipe for them not developing good social skills.

I guess that's it. I have to get my kids ready for school now.

You can't change what you've already done, but you can change what you do going forward.

Spending thousands of dollars to send him overseas on a trip he doesn't want sounds like a mistake.  In general, I think you need to start communicating with him and getting on the same page.  He's almost a grown adult and you can't just expect him to do whatever you ask.

I would suggest regularly setting aside time to get to talk and get to know him.  He's almost grown up and it sounds like you hardly know him.  Learn what's on his mind.  Learn what he thinks about life.  Learn what he sees for himself for the future.

Your role is going to become a support role as soon as he's an adult and out of your house, so now's a great time to start.

How does he buy enough weed to be a stoner? Are you giving him money? Does he have a job?
---
I'm a mom & I've worked as a juvenile probation officer. You should continue with therapy as a priority. But you also need to stop making it possible for him to get weed or vape (ie stop giving him money). You should consider taking his phone & other non life sustaining sources of comfort & allowing him to earn those things back. Lectures will fall on deaf ears so set some boundaries and stick to them. It's not going to be easy. People only change when they have to or it benefits them. If he gets in trouble,  don't let him miss out on feeling the consequences. It's much better he learns now than at 25. You might also benefit from researching how THC affects the brain development of teen boys. Best of luck, you're on a difficult path.
---
Is there a local mentorship program that he could affiliate with? Wouldn't be a bad idea if he's able to connect with older peers who recently started college as they have more insights into ""growing up"".


Don't lose hope. Many of the trashy/pothead/rebels at my high-school turned a 360 after grad and are now successful people heading into their 40s.


Sure, you fucked up the disciplining part, but it's correctable. He needs guidance. He needs a real look into the life he's headed towards. And a good look at a life that he wants to have and how to get there. He needs a mentor with a good head on their shoulder

AskAnAustralian,young people and social media ban,Has anyone else noticed a massive surge in anti-Indigenous sentiment in the last couple of years?,"Now I grew up in remote and regional Queensland in the 80s, so as a kid I was exposed to plenty of racist attitudes, jokes and comments at the expense of Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander people. But that kind of thing seemed to become less and less widespread and socially-acceptable throughout much of the nineties and two-thousands.

Over the last couple of years though I've seen a *massive* resurgence in overt, direct racism being expressed in person and in comments sections. You only have to look on Reddit to see anyone even mentioning that they're Indigenous being downvoted into oblivion, and people openly expressing just vile, dehumanising, sometimes genocidal beliefs. 

How did we get here? I know the Voice referendum brought a lot of ugliness to the surface, but it feels like it's more than that - can anyone explain this shift in attitudes (in what looks to be particularly among young men)?

I recently watched a film from the 90s about the experiences of Aboriginal people on Flinders Island. An old lady was explaining that her mother told her to say she was Māori instead of Aboriginal so she wouldn’t get abused/picked on/discriminated. 

I thought that kind of racism had gone away until I started to read a few community Facebook comment sections.
---
I haven't noticed any animosity first hand but I do know that when people's basic needs aren't being met (food, shelter, healthcare etc) it's a lot harder to feel open and understanding to others when they may feel (rightly or wrongly) that another group is getting preferential treatment. This housing crisis and cost of living crisis and mental health crisis... it's all piling up, making it harder and harder to be as kind to others as we should when our only priority is keeping our heads above water. As usual, the only real divide we should be concerned with is that between the haves and have nots. Tax the rich, solve wealth inequality and the rest of our divisions (like racism) become much less insurmountable.
---
I live in FNQ, and the amount of racism I see on Facebook is absolutely disgusting. I have an Aboriginal friend who has said they worry about discrimination/racism just asking questions to a staff member of a restaurant or store as well as a family friend who herself is white, but worries about her Aboriginal children being attacked on the street. Racist people have always (and will always) exist, but I think the media and a general lack of education play a huge part in it.

I think the reason is twofold 

1. What some view as constant anti-Australian propaganda being pushed by loud voices on the left (Australia is illegitimate, colonisation was a totally bad thing with zero positives, the welcome to country and acknowledgement to country stuff in tons of contexts where to some people it feels very annoying).

2. Indigenous people are massively overrepresented in crime. This is a fact. In towns where they have a big presence (Cairns, Darwin, Townsville) they commit ALOT of property crime, assaults, etc. The common perception is that they get away with being given bail and then light sentences, especially juveniles. People are already doing it tough financially. Add incessant break ins and attempted break ins and it isn't hard to see why tensions are boiling over. 

I tried to be objective there and just present facts. I do have sympathy for the plight of indigenous Australians but it's also a fact that they are hugely overrepresented amongst the criminals, substance abusers and generational welfare recipients.",2025-04-13 04:10:46,False

We have been.    Now… more.       All the things that people were justifiably upset about with the Snowden revelations…. Clearly in the span of about a decade since… have now become just things that are expected and accepted violations of privacy by most civilians even when done by private business etc let alone governments.   So this political moment that acts as a revelation or reminder of such things to many who are also justifiably upset about the rise of oligarchy etc… must be utilized to spread truth and awareness and teach critical thinking for starters.    I have paraphrased what I’m about to say  on various platforms and under various usernames for years… but an Afghani man or maybe it was simply an lesser known Arab leader…was interviewed on bbc world service some 15 or more years ago … and he said the important yet painful part of all this:    It took generations to get in this clusterfuck situation.

teenagers,young people and social media ban,UPDATE: I told my cousin everything.,"Okay so, most of you may recognize me from that one ""Are my parents strict?? :3"" post. Well, I was shocked at the amount of comments telling me my parents are abusive and that I have to tell someone. And although it took alot of courage, it gave me the final push I needed to open up to cousin. 

I basically broke down in tears and told her everything, she comforted me and said I didn't deserve any of this, and basically stated most of the same things people in the comments were saying, such as me basically living in a jail, that it was dicatorship, etc.

I decided to stay over with her at my grandma's house for the night, and am still there as I'm currently writing this. I honestly wish I could stay here forever, but I'm going to have to go home soon. We're going on a trip tomorrow, and I most likely won't see her for a long while after this.

You know, my mom called to check up on me last night, because she saw me crying. I told her I was okay and that it was because i was feeling sick. I still love my parents, my mom especially. However, I'm not really sure how to feel about my dad anymore, my mom has wanted to divorce him multiple times in the past, and I think that it might actually happen soon. 

I'm scared, and I genuinely don't know what to do. But, I'm sure I'll make it through this, I will be okay, so please, don't worry about me too much. I want to say thank you to those who were concerned for me after reading my post, alongside my other online friends. I wouldn't have ended up opening up if it wasn't for you guys.

And to those of you wondering if my post was satire or bait, im sad to inform you that it was not. I genuinely thought all of these things were normal until now, and still do to an extent. Moreover, I have enough fake internet points to sustain me for a lifetime, I don't have any reason to bait.

Alongside this, I don't appreciate my situation being turned into a meme and trend in this subreddit. It genuinely hurt, and still does now. I was being serious, and have been mocked due to it. People have even went as far to send me dms labeling me as a ""cringy attention seeker"" and more. 

I know it's the internet, and that these things are expected. But please, learn to me more respectful. Please stop making fun of my post, and harassing me for mine. You suck, and I hope that one day you'll change for the better.

Lastly, I'd like to announce that I won't be online this week as much due to the trip, but I promise i'll be back soon. 

Anyways, that's all for now. Here's the link to the post if you're confused: https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1hivdo6/are_my_parents_strict_3/

About the memeing thing:

It's shitty that people are making fun of posts like this. BUT... it's like that precisely *because* your situation is depressingly not unique. 

There's a lot of posts like this here and in other communities, and have been since the Internet began, because it's a safe place to get help and advice very quickly. Home based abuse tries to isolate people from support, and online communities offer unblockable connection and support. 

So, you're not alone here. And people who don't understand, but are seeing the same kinds of posts over and over and think it's fake? They are too small-minded to realize that it's because there really are that many people scared and trapped around them; it's too frightening of a reality for them to even consider.  So they're just a symptom of how *not alone* you really are

Parenting,Online Safety Amendment Act 2024,My son is behaving strangely and my wife doesn’t see it,"My wife and I are both 34 and we have two children: a girl (7yo) and a boy (13yo). 

Neither of our children have ever had any behavioural issues and have always had calm and sweet temperaments. 

Recently (about 4/5 months ago) my son started behaving strangely. He started spending all his time in his room, alternating between being aggressive towards us and isolating himself. At first I thought it was just typical teenage behaviour and I didn’t think too much of it. Until it started escalating. He started becoming very violent towards his younger sister which he had never been before. Both kids recently spent the night at my parents house and they expressed their concerns regarding him as he had insulted my mother heavily and threatened to smash the tv which is completely out of character for him. I tried having a conversation with him but he just stares me down and refuses to say anything. 

I tried talking about this with my wife but she told me she doesn’t see anything unusual with him. At first I got angry at her because how can she not see the shift in behaviour. But then I realised that he never acts like this towards her. Towards his mother he is as sweet as ever and he also tones down is bad behaviour towards the rest of the family when she is home. He always tells her everything about his day and is very affectionate towards her. As soon as she is at work he goes back to his horrible behaviour. He is so violent towards his sister I am starting to worry about her safety but my wife still doesn’t get it. Whenever I bring it up she tells me he is just going through adolescence and that I am overreacting. I started punishing him more harshly for his behaviour but instead of supporting me my wife is against me. 

I tried taking him to a psychologist but he can act very calm and reasonable when he wants to so the psychologist told me there is nothing wrong with him even though I know it’s not true. He smashed a plate this morning when I told him we were going to be late for school (my wife works from 6am to 3pm so I handle the drop offs she handles the pick ups). 

I am unsure how to handle the situation better. Talking hasn’t worked (he won’t talk or listen to me) psychologist didn’t work and wife is not on my side. I don’t want to push my son away and keep punishing him without him learning anything but I am worried about his future and my daughter’s safety.

As a person who has seen 3 professional therapists in my life I can assure you they’re not all the same and vary in effectiveness from client to client. I absolutely would not stop attempting to find a therapist that can effectively crack open his head should he continue to be violent toward other people. If necessary you need to get his behavior on film too if your wife continues to dismiss you.

Parenting,social media age restriction Australia,"My best friend cut me off six years ago when I became a mom, and she just reached out.","Seven years ago I (34F) got pregnant with my oldest son. ‘Jenna’ (same age) and I were best friends and had been since our freshman year of high school, and at the time she and her husband were trying to conceive, unsuccessfully. They couldn’t afford any kind of fertility treatments and had been trying for about a year when I got pregnant.

I knew Jenna was down about it not having happened for her, and out of respect for her feelings, I told her separately before my husband and I announced I was pregnant and I made sure not to talk too much to her about my pregnancy. Nevertheless Jenna started pulling away and by the time my son was born, I was hearing from her maybe once a week if I was lucky, whereas before I got pregnant, we used to talk every day and see each other multiple times a week. 

I tried not to take this personally but it was hard. Jenna and I were roommates in college for three years, we traveled Europe together after college, we were in each other’s weddings, our families even became friends. But I chalked her behavior up to it being difficult to see me having what she wanted the most, and I still continued to reach out and try to talk about anything but babies/pregnancy. 

Around the time my son was seven months old, and not having seen her for almost ten months at that point, I texted her and asked if we could please meet up for coffee and talk, because I really missed her and wanted us to be close again, and that if there was something I’d done to upset her, to please tell me so I could apologize. A full three days later she responded “That’s okay. I wouldn’t want to take you away from your family.” I cried for weeks; it was just confirmation of what I’d suspected and it literally felt like I was mourning a death; she even blocked me on all social media and her mom pulled back from her friendship with my mom, which hurt my mom as well. 

Fast forward to now. I have another son now and while I have a great friend group, I wouldn’t say I have a best friend per se, and I’ve still missed Jenna a lot. Yesterday morning I checked my email and saw she had sent me a long message. She started by apologizing for ending our friendship over her jealousy, and told me that she and her husband are finally expecting a baby; they saved up for years and did IVF, but because of some complications, she’s on bed rest for the remainder of her pregnancy, and since she’s had so much time on her hands she’s started seeing a therapist and has realized how wrong she was back then. 

I’m really torn on this. On the one hand, I miss Jenna and the friendship we used to have. But on the other hand, I’m so hurt that she cut me off for the crime of having a baby and couldn’t manage her emotions around it enough to be my friend. I was weirdly hoping I’d done something else and that my having a baby wasn’t really the reason. She also mentioned in her email that none of her friends have reached out or come to visit her while she’s been on bed rest, and it made her realize exactly how isolated I must have felt when I became a mom. So I can’t help but feel like she’s only reaching out because she’s lonely and not because she actually misses me as a friend, and it also stings that this is what it took for her to apologize.

I know I don’t owe her a response, but I remember how much it hurt me when she would go weeks without responding to me, and I don’t want to do the same to her. And as much as I miss her friendship, I weirdly feel like I’d be disrespecting myself if I took her back after how she treated me. I remember actually wishing she’d have just cussed me out the minute she found out I was pregnant, instead of the slow ghost, which was so much more painful and cruel.

This is very well written, you could honestly send her what you’ve written here. Be honest and say you can’t give her a yes or no because you’re confused and hurt. You don’t need to give her an answer you don’t know
---
She ducked up and she’s aware of it. It’s cost her a ton. You have every right to be hurt, you have every right to be done with her. 

Also I hear a very emotionally mature person who wants to give someone another chance and that says a lot about you. 

If you go back it will probably take a while.  You might be a bit more guarded about letting her in because you are going to be concerned about being hurt again. 

If you say no would you regret it more than if you said yes?  Are you going to struggle with the thought that you could have given her another chance or do you have closure from her admitting what went wrong.  Your answer to this is what you need to do.
---
What do you WANT to do? Not what is the *right thing* or what do you think is fair or any of the other things. What do YOU want? It's okay to be selfish here. This is your life and your emotional labor and vulnerability. 

You also don't have to have an answer right now. You can start and try it out but if it isn't working anymore, you can just say that. You can also reply and say you appreciate the apology and hope she's well but you need some time to think this over because you already grieved the friendship and didn't expect this. There are lots of options here and the thing is, no one's opinion matters more than yours.
---
I have been in a situation like this, best friend of 10 years whom I considered a sister, dropped off the face of the earth and cut me off completely. This happened with little warning. 

It took me years and years of grief over losing this connection to reflect and realize maybe she was doing me a favor in the end. I would kill to have the apology you received so that maybe you can obtain closure. 

This being said, I tend to agree with your husband. Accept the apology for your own happiness but not allow her to be close to you again. If you do let her back in your life, I would keep it minimal. I think how people treat their friends says a lot about them as a person. The fact that she was able to do this to the both of you is heartbreaking. She and you cannot un-ring the damage that has been done. If you do have a relationship, it will never ever be what it was. 

I’m glad she apologized and is working on herself. And people do change if they want to. I wish you and her well! You will come to the right conclusion after a lot of reflection!",2023-11-08 14:57:23,False

Skilled trades where every day the challenges are different. 

Like a plumber, not every house will have a pipe plugged up in the same way. Some houses have pipes from the 1900s while others have modern installations. Electricians, there are still homes wired with knob and tube systems from the 1800s, some from the 1950s, and modern new construction.

With rising inflation, device repair jobs will expand. Your laptop breaks today and most people just order a new one. But where cash is super tight, you may take it to the shop on the corner and someone repairs it for a few dollars by soldering in a new port/chip/whatever.

So i will say this, because I know people are gonna be all ""back in my day my friends came to my house for pizza and cake!""...

I went to a pizza and cake at home party for 10 7yo's yesterday, and in addition to the poor mom looking like she had *regrets* about this, it was *ear-splittingly* loud. Like my ears were ringing for hours after as though I'd gone to a concert. It was a difficult 2 hours to endure. 

I do not want that in my own house. And I will *happily* spend $300 or whatever to have that noise happen *anywhere else*. My kid has an early winter birthday, so outdoors is too much of a gamble, weather-wise (my friends with kids whose birthdays are in like May/June often take that gamble and usually win, because even if it rains, rainy and 85 is just wet, not miserable for kids if you hand them some water balloons. Rainy and 50 is miserable).

So doing the outsourced birthday party may look like showing off, but for some of us, it's self-preservation.

Yeah, it really depends what circles you run in. Most of our friend group is pretty chill. Provide friends, food, and enough activities to keep the children occupied for two hours, and everyone is satisfied.

But, my kid goes to a fancy private school, and I've heard stories from some other parents about some absolutely bananas parties thrown by some of the parents. Like circus performers in a mansion type of parties. My kid hasn't been to one of those yet, and I'm really looking forward to attending one if it happens, but I'm never going to try and do it myself.

Skip the ad
Mass surveillance, emotion recognition, social scoring... The European Commission clarified on Tuesday which artificial intelligence (AI) systems, deemed too dangerous, were now banned within the EU under its  pioneering legislation adopted last year . Eight cases of bans were identified by the Commission.

1. Real-time identification of people using cameras in public places
The EU bans the use of cameras equipped with real-time facial recognition technology on a shopping street to identify wanted individuals. The notion of ""real time"" is crucial here. The EU wants to avoid immediate intervention against an individual, without prior verification with other information from the real world. However, exemptions are provided for certain law enforcement missions such as the fight against terrorism.

2. Social rating based on personal data unrelated to the assessed risk
An organization cannot use an AI application to rank people based on their likelihood of committing welfare fraud, using personal data that has nothing to do with the context, such as race, skin color or behavior on social networks. Thus, to assess the risk of default on a loan, only financial data could be taken into account.

3. Assessment of an individual's criminal risk based on biometric data
Police cannot use AI to predict an individual's risk of criminal behavior, such as the likelihood of rioting or committing an attack, based solely on personal characteristics, such as facial features, without taking into account objective and verifiable facts directly related to their actions.

4. Create face databases for facial recognition systems by retrieving images from the internet
Tools that scrape the Internet and extract photos of faces indiscriminately to create large-scale databases of billions of images are banned. This would amount to state surveillance.

5. Recognition of emotions in the workplace or in educational institutions
An organization cannot use webcams or voice recognition systems to detect the emotions of its employees.

6. Manipulating individual behavior using AI
It is prohibited to integrate deceptive or subliminal AI systems into the design of an interface to push users to make a purchase.

7. Exploiting age or disability vulnerabilities
A toy, incorporating AI and designed to interact with children, is prohibited if it is designed to retain their attention and encourage them to engage in risky challenges that could injure them.

8. Inferring political views or sexual orientation based on biometric data
A system that claims to be able to guess people's political views or sexual orientation from facial analysis would not be allowed in the EU.

privacy,young people and social media ban,Nikki Haley vows to abolish anonymous social media accounts: 'It's a national security threat',"  
WASHINGTON (TND) — Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley says a lack of transparency over social media is becoming detrimental to the American population.  
“When I get into office, the first thing we have to do, social media companies, they have to show America their algorithm,” Haley said during an interview with Fox News Tuesday. “Let us see why they’re pushing what they’re pushing.”  
Haley continued, saying she fears a rise in anonymous social media accounts could lead to widespread misinformation and potentially pose a national security threat.  
“Every person on social media should be verified by their name. It’s a national security threat,"" she said. ""When you do that, all of a sudden people have to stand by what they say and it gets rid of the Russian bots, the Iranian bots and the Chinese bots.”

minors, especially girls, shouldn't post photos of themselves online especially in places like reddit. i swear to god i say this to like five posts a day on various subreddits.

there are so many pedos here. not just that, but even people who don't actively interact can save your photo and do whatever the hell they want with it. 

*edit: people seem to be forgetting that pedos DMing you aren't the only threat here. deepfake porn is an entirely real problem that has been affecting lots of teenagers and people around the world in recent years. those photos, aside from being illegal and disgusting, can come back to harm you and negatively affect your life. even appropriate photos of yourself can be altered using AI. please keep this in mind before posting a picture of yourself*

if you need to post a photo of yourself, blur or cover your face entirely, double check that there's no personally identifying or location-revealing information in the photo, and delete the post a few days after you post it.

Parenting,kids off social media,Normalize boredom,"I work in the video games industry. I do a lot of child safety design stuff as a byproduct. One thing that has me pulling my hair out is the number of parents who let their kids play games that aren't safe.

""But all her friends play Roblox!""

...and if all her friends jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge, you'd what?

""It's just a game. It's numbers and pixels.""

It's an art form *and* it's social media. If you wouldn't want your 13-year-old son to see Saving Private Ryan's opening scene 5 times, why are you letting him play Call of Duty? If you're not comfortable letting your 8-year-old chat with random guys on Instagram, why are you letting her chat with random guys (pretending to be kids) on Roblox?

Do you know where the game's Report button is? Did you understand what ""public server"" means?

At this point, the parents are near tears. ""What am I supposed to DO?!"" they eventually ask.

Normalize boredom. That's the answer. It sucks and it's hard -- but nobody ever died of boredom. Video games are a wonderful boredom-killer but boredom doesn't *need* to be killed. 

Don't shove a phone or a tablet at them. Don't shell out for a PS5 to put in their bedroom so you never have to see or hear them. Do not treat Fortnite, Roblox, or Minecraft like babysitters.

Just let your kids be bored. ",939,64,joygirl007,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1jqkhyq/normalize_boredom/,2025-04-03 14:52:11,"And for anyone still doubting: boredom stimulates imagination and creativity in kids :)

""But I might be bored!"" Yeah? And? So what? You'll be fine!

Totally agree. Learning to be at peace with ones own company, learning to deal with tedium, with the passage of time even when painfully slow, etc are all important life lessons.

There are also plenty off kid friendly, safe, offline games if you have old consoles. Or I'd imagine a PC that you could potentially download the game and play without internet?

It wasn't a constant problem, mostly an intermittent one. But when asking questions, ordering in bars, cafes etc, I had a lot of people would freeze, stop, and look confused and be like 'Sorry, what?""  ""Huh?"" ""Can you repeat that?""

I would repeat myself. I'd get asked again to clarify. Then I would. Articulate. Every. Word. Very. Pre-cise-ly. And make sure to say hard R's and pronounce every consonant. Only then would they understand. Once this initial communication was established, they then seemed to be able 'shift' to comprehend this type of English and they didn't have trouble understanding me for the rest of the convo.

A couple of folks I AirBNB'd at were South American and Spanish expats. They told me this is a common thing in the USA, mostly because, unlike Europe and countries of the Commonwealth, American TV and media does not feature a lot of non-American English shows. So Americans at large are not exposed to a lot of accents at a young age like we are (Aussie, British, Scottish, Irish, Kiwi, American, Canadian).

australia,Australia under 16 social media ban,"When did we become such a ""Think of the children"" society?","I mean as a kid growing up in the 90's, there was an element of ""Think of the children"" with the ""RBT, anytime, anywhere"" becoming hyper big.

""Speed kills"" being flashed with graphic accidents on TV, and again, you don't want your kids to grow up without a parent.

Just seems in the last few years though, we have taken a sharp turn, and we've rushed a lot of new laws through under the ""think of the children"" guise, which aren't actually helping children (and weren't targeted at it in the first place), or will be easily bypassed by children.

I mean, just looking at recent news:

★Social media bill to ban under 16's (who will circumvent with a VPN)

★Requiring vapes to be purchased from a pharmacy (which just pushed legitimate customers to the black market kids were already buying from)

★Misinformation Bill (Government gets to decide what is misinformation)

★A number of bills to pay other countries to take refugees to Australia, and deport even more people, including changes to anchor visas (because we don't want them in our communities...right? Doesn't matter if they have been here for years, Mum/Dad is getting deported)

★New caravan laws saying someone can't live in a caravan on your own property if it's more 20m² (older kids, Nanna, Uncle Dave)

★Nah, despite privacy concerns, Clearview AI is still good in Australia. Doesn't matter if your privacy is invaded, anything to catch criminals is good, because who wants criminals on the street?

I mean, I get it, we need to look after our kids. As a father myself, I want my son to be safe in the world.

But I also don't think it's right to make sweeping law changes and be like ""But the children""

I mean, when I was a kid in the 90's, my parents controlled my access to tech, I only got so much screen time. I plan to do the same with my son as he gets older. No need for the government to do it for me. In fact, I'd prefer they didn't do my job for me.

If my son becomes a teenager and starts purchasing black market ciggies or vapes or whatever is the trend, I don't support any bans of legitimate businesses who aren't breaking the law. Like the vape ban, it just destroyed the lives of legitimate businesses and fuelled the black market.

As for the caravan laws, my father in law has always had a plan for retirement, and we're on board, his plan has been to get himself a caravan, and love either with me and my wife, or with my Brother in Law, or switch between us. We have room on our properties to have him. He's run the numbers, unless he needs medical care, most of those OAP communities are an absolute scam for old people.

Why can't he pull up a van for a few months at a time and stay? It's not hurting anyone.

But I've heard ""Think of the children, should they be exposed to people living in a van?""

I mean, my son will see his Pop getting to have his own space, jamming on his guitars, loving his best life, and if he feels like it, packing up and being able to move on, be a bit of a nomad for a few months. Enjoy the fruits of a lifetime of hard work and sacrifice to raise his kids.

I mean, how is seeing someone enjoying their sunset years bad for kids?

I mean, this is just the last 12 months I'm looking at.

It just amazes me the *speed* with which they rammed this bill through. Shows they're capable of efficiency when it suits them.

I see the problem differently. To me it's not about government overreach, it's about the refusal of successive governments to actually govern, and allowing systemic problems to take root so deeply that they become very difficult to regulate, leading to extreme ""emergency"" band aids, like the social media ban, and absolute failures like the housing crisis. 

If we, as voters, thoughtfully engaged with politics we might have not let the social contract become so broken, but here we are. Broken media, broken healthcare, broken education, housing crisis, cost of living crisis, pathetic populist politicians and culture war after culture war distracting us from working together to fix things.

Just saw a post on ABC Insta that was a story about how access to paracetamol could be adjusted as there are teenagers who are using it to self harm via overdose.

I audibly groaned. While of course teen mental health is important, we do not need stronger laws preventing casual purchases of bloody paracetamol!! We need better mental health care and awareness in general.

Parenting,young people and social media ban,I’m starting to get so sick of all the stares…,"I (M23) and my wife (F22) have 2 kids. A one year old boy, and a 3 month old little girl. We wanted kids, we tried for kids, we got our kids, and then she got her tubes tied. When she got pregnant the first time, so many people told us how we messed up because we were giving up all of our freedom, etc. When we had the second, everyone said we were making a mistake because of the financial burden of having two children and it would be too much to take care of both of them. In public, people look at us with these pity looks all the time like our lives must be absolutely miserable. Old women make comments about how we got started young. Our friends act like we live the worst life imaginable. We WANTED these children. We LOVE these children. I wouldn’t trade these kids for anything in the world and I love every single moment of being their father. Just because we are young, it doesn’t mean we didn’t intentionally choose this life. They weren’t an accident and I’m tired of people acting like they are. On top of that, when my wife got her tubes tied, everyone said we would regret that because we would want more in the future. No. We wanted 2, we got 2, we are sticking with 2. How are you going to act like having kids is a mistake, and then act like preventing kids is a mistake? Sorry we like having sex without a piece of rubber between us. Neither one of us party, we don’t smoke, I don’t drink (she’ll have a glass or two of wine every couple days), we don’t have a big social life, we just want to be our little family on our little farm and be left alone.

Futurology,young people and social media ban,Social media brought out the worst of humans. Brain chips might be worse for society and culture than we can imagine,"In just 20 years, Social media gives pretty much everybody a voice, even a 4 year old on an IPad. And this leads to good sides and bad sides. My personal experience is that, aside from YouTube being generally good and useful, Instagram reels, Reddit, Twitter are more likely than not rampant with trolls, negativity, people who are miserable in real life sharing their miserable mind. Because the internet is so accessible, and gives a troll or a PhD’s opinion the same reach.

Looking into the future, brain chips will drastically lower the barrier to “put a thought out there”. 
Societal and culture gap will increase because we are wired to see areas of disagreement more than agreement. 

We can already see this happening in the US, and looking back the division seems like a natural product of psychology (tendency to remember the bad, the areas of disagreement, tendency to be defensive instead of nuanced when experiencing cognitive dissonance) and the internet, radio waves, etc, creating this societal-level consciousness that is having trouble resolving conflicting opinions

Am I extrapolating too much? If not, what can we do to reconcile as a society and prevent or reduce extremism? If we do it right, brain chips and AGI can be great for humanity’s culture.

It's very easy to farm engagement/big your points in the algorithm by starting an argument or controversial discussion. Real people do this yeah but it's a common marketing strategy atm employed by AI as well from both companies and political actors.

Yes. Social media gave people the power to comment, like and share. With no specific rules to what was the optimum boundary of safety. Powerful Tool. It can change the outcome of the election.

Social media has amplified the worst in humans by providing a platform where anonymity and algorithms reward outrage, polarization, and sensationalism. The desire for validation through likes and shares often encourages performative behavior, fake perfection, and divisive opinions. The lack of face-to-face accountability makes it easier to dehumanize others, while echo chambers isolate perspectives, fueling mistrust and hostility. Instead of fostering genuine connection, it frequently magnifies insecurities and amplifies conflict.

Your points are understandable but you may be overlooking the ever present corruptive and draining ubiquity of capitalism. Perhaps that is what is bringing out the worst in humans. The idea that we are in a zero sum game but simultaneously fighting for endless accumulation of resources. Sounds like a clearly sick society to me.

Parenting,Online Safety Amendment Act 2024,Husband is not the dad I thought he’d be?,"Hubby (35m) and I (35f) have been married for 6 years. 
We’ve always had a pretty good marriage.. we felt close and unbreakable. 
We went through our conception journey for 2 years before turning to IVF and had our beautiful baby boy in March 2024.

He was great during my pregnancy, took amazing care of me and I couldn’t wait to see him as a dad.

However a month or two after baby came things went downhill. My husband prioritised everything over me and the baby - all his personal needs above us. Going to the gym, work and just about everything else - he wasn’t very present at all. If he was at home he would spend that time playing with the baby for 20 minutes and rest of the time watching tv, or on his phone or in the shower claiming he “works all day” and I’m on “leave”. 

If I ever brought it up he’d just say that I’m controlling for asking him to cut down time at the gym (he goes 4 days week).. to spend with our son & support me.

He also started losing his patience with our son. It was all well and good when baby was happy and smiling but if he cried, I’d hear “shut up..”, “stop sooking”, “omg, does he know how to do anything else?”, and plenty of other things like this.

This has also caused me to become the default parent and I do everything.. my husband is rarely alone with our child.. I feed him, I change nappies, I bathe him, I put him to sleep every night 

We recently went on a holiday and my husband complained how it was a “waste of money” cause we can’t go out when he sleeps at night and we have to hear him cry everywhere and we have to change our schedules for his feeds 

Today my husband semi slammed the door in my baby’s face because he threw a toy on the floor 

I’m genuinely baffled at how someone can be so selfish and act this way to an infant, let alone their own baby? 

I’ve asked him to consider therapy and he said yes but has done nothing about it.

Stay or leave but you know your child is being objected to his abusive behavior. Screw everyone claiming that he has postpartum. That's BS. He was abusive BEFORE the baby arrived.

Protect your child, this behaviour is going to escalate. I am a father and was a stay at home dad from the time my child was 1, never in my life would I behave this way to the person I love unconditionally.

Then to complain that we kill threats and pests to our ecosystem by shooting them? We've tried the more humane ways but it doesn't fucking work long-term or with the additional costs and time given to it.

australia,Australia digital ID law,Should companies be allowed to remove digital media after you purchased it?,"There has been a growing trend in the last decade, mostly in but certainly not limited to the gaming space, for companies to make products you purchased digitally no longer function.

The excuses given are varied but it's becoming more and more clear the most common reason to do this is because a ""newer"" version of the product has become available and by ""breaking"" the old one your only recourse to use the digital goods is to buy the new one. They are essentially doing that good old [The Far Side comic](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ebme9lwWsAIyXvz.jpg) where a person has retrieved the brick thrown through their window only to find a note attached to it with an advertisement for a window replacement service.

Surely I'm not the only one fed up with this bullshit right? This would never fly with physical goods so why is it allowed with digital? Most likely because their aren't any laws on this yet.

Well, A new petition has just been put forwards in response to the growing trend of companies making digital products cease to function after  purchase. [https://www.aph.gov.au/e-petitions/petition/EN6080](https://www.aph.gov.au/e-petitions/petition/EN6080)

To  be completely transparent, this is part of a larger video game preservation movement being spearheaded by Ross Scott at Accursed Farms (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w70Xc9CStoE)

Just  as Australia was instrumental in securing the customer rights to Digital Refunds on the massive gaming platform Steam many years ago, it is hoped that we can once again benefit the gaming community through  this and other efforts currently being pursued by this movement. More information on the movement itself and how you can help at [https://www.stopkillinggames.com/](https://www.stopkillinggames.com/)



Here's the petitions wording to save you going off site if you're not 100% on board yet:

**Petition Reason**

An increasing number of software companies (foreign and local) publish software that is arbitrarily required to ‘phone home’ in order to function. This is especially prevalent in entertainment software such as videogames. Unlike normal software, when a publisher discontinues such products they do not simply end development and technical support – instead, they choose to render all copies of the software inoperable, effectively withdrawing customers’ rights under the Australian Consumer Law to ownership and undisturbed possession of their purchased goods. Many companies go to great lengths to prevent customers restoring their property to working order, withholding vital components of their function from end users. These practices rob customers of the product they fairly purchased, and make restoration and preservation impossible. Due to the technical nature of software products and current legislative ambiguity, clearer legislation is needed.

**Petition Request**

We therefore ask the House to enact legislation to: 1. Require software sold in Australia to remain in a functional state after the end of the product’s support period, continuing to operate without any intervention from the publisher. 2. Require publishers selling additional features/assets for their software to leave said software in a functional state after the end of the product’s support period, so customers can continue to utilise features/assets they purchased without any intervention from the publisher. 3. Establish that these requirements supercede software End-User License Agreements, as many such licenses attempt to strip customers’ right to ownership over their purchased goods, as guaranteed under schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010.",761,376,New_Importance2779,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1caq6y3/should_companies_be_allowed_to_remove_digital/,2024-04-22 23:57:02,"If buying isn’t owning, pirating isn’t stealing.
---
I feel that if a media site can no longer provide you with the media you purchased, they must offer a DRM-free download for you to keep, or worse case, a refund. This includes old versions of programs (eg. Photoshop)  
  
I also feel any media that has been discontinued, or is over a certain age, should be able to be shared freely to prevent it being lost permanently. People should be allowed to store and share old media to be enjoyed by future generations wanting to experience media's history.

No more companies ""renting"" media out until it loses profit and then deleting it from existence for no one to enjoy again. People should be able to keep the items they purchase, and media should be preserved for the future.

Get told that when they went out of business the app stayed active...... then someone bought the app and specificly nuked it. Now the app auto updates when you download it to a different app, that tells you a new company owns it, and to use it, you now have to buy a subscription....

I made [my own post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/18g5tza/theres_finally_a_real_chance_to_clamp_down_on_us/) a little before this but, but since this post is getting more attention:

**In ADDITION to telling to telling your representative to vote AGAINST this bill (The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence's ""FISA Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2023"" (FRRA, H.R. 6611))**

**Tell them to ALSO vote...**

- **AGAINST** The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence ""FISA Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2023"" (FRRA, S. 3351)

- and **AGAINST** the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) as long as the Section 702 renewal provision is included

- and to vote **FOR** The House Judiciary Committee ""Protect Liberty and End Warrantless Surveillance Act "" (PLEWSA, H.R. 6570)

- and also **FOR** the Bipartisan senate ""Government Surveillance Reform Act"" (GSRA, S.3234 / H.R. 6262)


The two FRRA bills both renew Section 702, and the House version actually massively expands surveillance, as this post is about. But the GSRA and PLEWSA both majorly LIMIT surveillance, and in a way that really matters rather then just being superficial and toothless: Your lawmakers will be more likely to vote against the two FRRA bills if you can suggest the GSRA and PLEWSA as alternatives.

**This is especially important because the House will be using Queen of the Hill rules between the house FRRA and PLEWSA, so whichever of the two gets more votes will move on and the other bill will die.**: You should specifically frame it to your representatives that it's a choice between those two bills, because it is: Even if you adamantly want Section 702 to expire entirely, it's still advantageous to tell your representatives to support PLEWSA in the short term so the house FRRA bill fails.

australia,Online Safety Amendment Act 2024,Melbourne residents receive letter offering $200k for information on Hong Kong pro-democracy activist | Hong Kong,"A small number of Melbourne residents have received anonymous letters purporting to offer a police bounty of $203,000 if they inform on an Australian citizen and pro-democracy activist wanted for alleged national security crimes in Hong Kong, linking him to two nearby locations.

A spokesperson for the foreign minister, Penny Wong, told Guardian Australia the letter was “deeply worrying” and that the matter would be raised directly with officials from China and Hong Kong.

The anonymous letter – mailed from Hong Kong and delivered to some Melbourne homes on Friday – contained a photograph of Kevin Yam with a headline alleging he was a “wanted person”. It then detailed a range of alleged “national security related offences” and offered HK$1m (A$203,000) from the Hong Kong police to anyone who provided information on his whereabouts or took him to Hong Kong or Australian police.

Yam is a lawyer who lived in Hong Kong for 20 years before returning to Australia in 2022. He is one of eight overseas-based activists, the subject of Hong Kong police arrest warrants, accused in July 2023 of breaching its controversial national security law that grants authorities sweeping extraterritorial powers to prosecute acts or comments made anywhere in the world that it deems criminal.

Yam has criticised the crackdown on dissent and erosion of judicial independence in the Chinese-controlled city and has been accused of encouraging foreign governments to impose sanctions against members of the judiciary, prosecutors and government officials.

It is not known who sent the letter but its language matches a public appeals notice published on the Hong Kong police force’s official website. A UK phone number included at the bottom of the letter has also been linked to the Hong Kong police force, which was contacted for comment.

The letter, which gives a detailed account of Yam’s physical appearance, listed a residential address in the Melbourne suburb of Abbotsford and another in the Melbourne CBD. The letter was sent to homes adjacent to these locations.

“A reward of $1m HKD is being offered by Hong Kong police to any member of the public who can provide information on this wanted person and the related crime or take him to Hong Kong and Australian metropolitan police,” the letter claimed.

The letter urged people with information on Yam’s whereabouts to contact Hong Kong police force’s national security department. It also noted Hong Kong’s secretary for security, Tang Ping-keung, declared Yam an “absconder in respect of offences endangering national security” on 24 December 2024.

Similar letters with the exact formatting were mailed to neighbours of former Hong Kong district councillor, Carmen Lau, who lives in the UK, earlier this month. Lau told NBC News she did not “feel safe living at my current address” as a result.

Wong’s spokesperson said the targeting of an Australian citizen was “completely unacceptable”.

“The Australian government will not tolerate surveillance, harassment or intimidation against individuals or family members here in Australia – this undermines our national sovereignty and the security and safety of Australians,” the spokesperson said.

“We are raising our concerns directly with Chinese and Hong Kong authorities.”

A Hong Kong government spokesperson said it would not issue an anonymous letter, but stressed it would “take every measure” to pursue those accused of breaching its national security law. This included “cutting off their funding sources, so as to prevent and suppress them from continuing to engage in acts and activities endangering national security”.

The shadow home affairs minister, James Paterson, described the letter as an “outrageous” and “totally unacceptable” example of foreign interference. He supported the government’s efforts to contact Chinese and Hong Kong officials.

“Those who distributed this pamphlet should be investigated under the espionage and foreign interference laws,” Paterson told Guardian Australia. “Serious consequences must flow to send the strong message we won’t tolerate this crude attempted intimidation”.

In July 2023, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning urged Australia, the UK and the US to stop sheltering the eight activists.

“Relevant countries need to respect China’s sovereignty and the rule of law in Hong Kong, stop lending support for anti-China elements destabilising Hong Kong, and stop providing a safe haven for fugitives,” she said.

When the warrant for his arrest was issued, Yam vowed not to be silenced. He said he felt an obligation to jailed fellow pro-democracy activists “not to shut up”. Since then, he has called on the Australian government to consider sanctions against Chinese officials.

In August last year, Yam told an Australian parliamentary inquiry “the Hong Kong authority’s act of placing a bounty over my head is by no means one of merely seeking to defend China’s national security”.

“They have in fact interfered with my exercise of fundamental freedoms and democratic rights as an Australian,” Yam told a Senate standing committee on foreign affairs, defence and trade. “If they can see fit to do this to me, in respect of normal democratic discourse and interactions that took place in Australia, they can do it to any Australian.”",712,119,shofmon88,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/17/melbourne-residents-offered-200k-to-inform-on-australian-pro-democracy-activist-wanted-in-hong-kong-ntwnfb?CMP=soc_567,2025-03-17 23:14:00,"Time to flood the tip line with lots of tips

I fondly remember when he got his VCE, he came over to our house with the paper and genuinely asked my mom “is a 99.5 enough to do law?” 

He went on to study law and his dream was to become a judge.

Regardless of your individual politics, I hope we can all agree that AEC staff and volunteers are wonderful and deserve not only our respect, but also our thanks.

We have it pretty good here, and that's largely due to the AEC and the people who give up their time to do a vital but largely thankless job on polling days.

You'd have to be living in a hole to not see the painful experience voting is for much of the U.S. population over their last few elections. While there is certainly a large difference in population size and therefore complexity, I think a lot of us (certainly myself) take the painless and very accessible system of voting here for granted. 

If any of the AEC staff or volunteers read this: thank-you for doing an absolutely vital job which is none-the-less largely thankless and receives little-to-no recognition. You are rockstars to a person, and if I had my way, we would celebrate National AEC Appreciation Day the Sunday after any voting day.

Parenting,young people and social media ban,Why are teenage boys so clueless?,"My teenage daughter is friends with a boy from her school. He’s had a crush on her for a while and she’s starting to develop feelings for him too. They are not dating, have only hung out in group settings, and never even kissed. He’s a bit awkward and never had a girlfriend and I think is just clueless about how to handle the fact that a girl likes him back. He’s a nice kid, I will often overhear their conversations and he is very sweet to her. Never did anything that was a red flag and has always been super respectful. So…. this kid decides it’s a good idea to send her a d**k pic!!!! My daughter tells me everything and was shocked, half the story she told me was full of gagging sounds. Thankfully she’s a confident and mature kid and basically told him “Why did you send me that? What made you think it was a good idea? Never send me that again”. His response was that he thought she’d like it (WTF?) and he’d never do it again. But that made her think of him in a whole different light and she’s grossed out by him now. Seriously, ewww gross! It was totally wrong of him to send it, but something in his undeveloped brain made him think that was a good idea. I honestly  don’t get creepy pervy vibes from this kid, I think he is just incredibly dumb and something he saw on social media (or something his idiot friends told him) made him think it was a good idea.

Parenting,online safety for teenagers,PSA Drowning Prevention,"This is a lot to read. I apologize in advance. I am sharing this to hopefully raise awareness and share some lessons my family have had to learn through an incredibly traumatic experience.

My husband and I took our sons, 14 months and 5 years, to Epcot last Saturday. We were very exhausted but had a busy week ahead of us and decided that since the boys were sleeping soundly in their seats, we could bring them home, grab our dog, and take her to my mom's house instead of boarding her. We would stay the night before leaving to head out of town for work the following day.
We put my younger son in the guest room and my oldest slept in a bed he has in my parent's room. My husband and I opted to sleep on the couch because our youngest is an incredibly light sleeper and even one of us shifting in bed will wake him up. By the time the boys were soundly in bed and we had showered and laid down, it was past midnight.
My teenage brother pulled an all-nighter with his friend playing video games that night and at about 6:00 AM was loud enough that he woke my son up.
My husband went to get my son and brought him to me so I could nurse him and get him to calm down. He nursed for a while before deciding he was ready to start the day. My husband was laying beside me and I handed my son to him, asking him to take him so I could get some rest. He sleepily agreed.
I must not have fully fallen asleep because I noticed my husband was beside me still, but our son was not with him.
Immediately my heart stopped. My mom has a dog door that my son crawls out of to an enclosed porch with a pool. I asked where he was and without a response, we were both out of bed running outside.
I knew when I heard my husband jump into the pool that my worst fears were confirmed. My baby was in the pool, floating face-down.
I saw him and thought he was dead. I screamed and my parents were outside shortly after my husband retrieved him. He handed him to me and in a miraculous moment that will forever be the most relieving of my entire life, my son vomited water and started crying.
My dad was a first responder in the past and immediately started working on him, getting him to vomit what felt like gallons of water. He did not need CPR but I was still terrified something would be wrong. How long had he gone without oxygen?
He was responsive but dazed, and we needed to be sure he was okay. An ambulance met us halfway to the hospital and took us to the emergency room where we watched as relief flooded the faces of the responders who were expecting the worst. My son had a reflex that caused his epiglottis to shut his trachea and open his esophagus. This is why he had swallowed water instead of inhaling it.
He is safe. He is healthy. He is happy. We are recovering and making adjustments so this never happens again.

Things we have learned:
- Dog doors are dangerous. I read story after story of babies who went out of dog doors before drowning. I know it sounds like common sense but my son is NEVER left unattended so until now we thought it was cute that he would try to crawl through it. After all, it never happened without us watching and he never made it more than a foot out of it before me or his dad grabbed him up.
- We have implemented a system where we do a verbal call and response to ensure that whoever is watching the baby knows they are solely responsible and need to be distraction free and fully awake and aware. This sounds like ""Your [Baby's Name]"", ""My [Baby's Name]"". If you are unsure that the person is fully capable (In this case, I should not have given responsibility to my half-awake husband. That is on me), the child should remain your responsibility.
- Our sons are signed up for ISR classes. They are expensive but if you can do it, DO IT. They could save your child's life and we were kicking ourselves for never getting around to it.
- If you can't afford ISR lessons, find a vendor who takes Drowning Coalition vouchers. This is a program that assists families within 200% of the Federal Poverty Level.
- Even if you don't have a pool, your child needs to be able to swim. In Florida, drowning is the number 1 cause of unintentional death for babies and young children. Every professional I've spoken to said it is very often a neighbor's or grandparent's pool.
- Get CPR Certified. Most people who were with us that day were and although we didn't need to use it, we had multiple parties ready to act.
- It CAN happen to you. We are good parents. We watch our kids very closely and we are overly-protective about everything. We never thought this would happen to us. I know it sounds naive.
- Pool gates should be automatic closure latch-and-lock systems. It's even better if you can get an alarm.
- There are pool alarms that sense disturbances on the surface of water. I had never heard of these until all of this.

Please refrain from passing judgment. We feel so incredibly guilty and our gut-reaction was to keep this quiet. We changed our mind when we realized how little we knew about drowning and how much we have learned since. We wish we had someone to tell us about all of this beforehand.
We were so, so lucky. We hope that by sharing this story, we can help prevent someone else from experiencing a situation like ours or worse.

EDITED TO ADD
Thank you, everyone for taking the time to read this post. And for the support and resources shared in the replies.
I wanted to point out a couple of things that I read in replies that are important.
- Drowning is a silent event. It is something that can happen in a pool surrounded by responsible adults if one person had not been specifically designated to watch.
- Drowning can happen in as little as an inch of water.
- Live Like Jake is an organization that offers scholarships and resources for drowning prevention.
- Swimsuit/clothing color is an important consideration when planning to swim or be near water. Bright colors that are easily seen in water are best. Avoid blues, greens, and blacks. There are guides online that are helpful in choosing the safest swimwear colors.
- I read a reply that states that ISR has not been proven to prevent drowning and that the AAP recommends against these lessons. The AAP's website states that they do not recommend swimming lessons for infants under one as a preventative measure against drowning. It does state that lessons after one are beneficial. If you want more info and additional prevention tips, check out this page:
https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/drowning-prevention-and-water-safety/
- Pool fences are a great barrier to prevent accidental drownings. It's been said here time and time again, but I thought I'd include it here as well. The pool this happened in is enclosed and fully permitted because the enclosure itself is considered a barrier meeting the legal requirements. It still was not enough due to the dog door.",691,120,SnooMarzipans8030,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1ehlo1h/psa_drowning_prevention/,2024-08-01 16:55:30,"r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

No judgment at all.  Thank you for sharing your story.  Sharing stories like this is so important because people don't realize it doesn't take a massive amount of neglect for an accident like this to happen.  All it takes is a human error, a moment where each parent reasonably assumes the other is watching a baby, for something horrible to happen.

Dog doors are also dangerous because dogs that aren’t yours and other animals like raccoons can get inside your house. Dogs have been killed in their own homes that way by loose dogs - same thing could happen to a small child.

Parenting,young people and social media ban,My Child Won't Stop Catfishing Adults,"My partner and I keep catching our (14F) child catfishing people. She isn't our bio child, she's our niece that we took guardianship of about 6 months ago. Previously she lived in a house with no order or rules and her bio mom did not intervene, so she came to us having spent the last few years catfishing people. Typically older men, with her pretending to be 18 or 19.

The first time we found out what was happening we had a long conversation about trafficking and then dangers of engaging in illicit conversations with older men, blocked her contact with these individuals, and started monitoring her communication using Bark.

The catfishing continued, so we eventually took away her phone and social media accounts and only let her have phone/text access via a Bark phone and limited Roblox.

Since then she's been better so we gave her the original phone back and let her have social media again, where we discovered she's returned to catfishing and having adult conversations where she's sharing fake pics and soliciting photos from others. 

What would you do in this situation? Have you ran into this?

She is showing you she is not ready to handle the responsibility of her original phone and social media. Maybe in a few years, but not right now. You need to take away her access to these things to keep her safe. It's not a punishment, it's a guardrail.

If she's not already in counseling or therapy, I would get her in there asap to make sure there's not something darker behind the behavior, i.e. she's role-playing out abuse that happened to her.

Obviously, stop allowing her the phone and social media. If she needs a phone, get her one she can’t access the internet on. 

She also could probably benefit from therapy based on her past.

There has never, in the history of parenting problems, ever been a situation where “I will let them watch MTV’s Catfish” has been a plan that produced positive results.

You need to adjust your timelines, expectations, and support systems.  You're talking about an extremely damaged adolescent, who probably has malformed ideas of interpersonal relationships and emotions.  You can't give her a twenty minute pep talk on accountability and expect that she's going to discard years of emotional neglect and stop attempting to manipulate people.

1. She almost certainly needs professional support - therapy and regular accountability checks
2. She needs adults she can trust, who love her, and who give her stability
3. Throw her phone away and keep her off the internet - not for a day or a week but for months or years.

She need a long time and it will take a lot of work to reset her expectations. Otherwise she's going to keep manipulating you until she ages out of your care.",2024-03-11 15:35:06,False

If you look at change.org right now, the two top petitions on the website are advocating for this. One was started by newscorp and has almost 50,000 signatures. The other was started by a group called ""36 months"" and has almost 100,000 signatures. 

36 months was supposedly started by Michael Wipfli, AKA Wippa from Nova's Fitzy and Wippa breakfast show. I doubt he's got the know how to organize something like this himself. Nova is owned by a company called Illyria Pty Ltd, which is owned by Lachlan Murdoch. Call me suspicious but I'm betting newscorp is really behind this ""36 months"" campaign as well and old Wippa is just the turkey they've strutted out to promote it. 

This push to ban kids from social media is straight out of the republican playbook in the US. It's not clear why they're doing it or why newscorp wants this but you can bet your bottom dollar no good will come of it. The only way to police this would be to have some sort of database where people have to register to use social media.

AustralianPolitics,social media age restriction Australia,Election 2025: Kooyong Liberal candidate Amelia Hamer pitched herself as a renter. She owns two investment properties,"**Rachael Dexter, April 7, 2025 — 5.00am**

Amelia Hamer, the Liberal Party’s great hope to wrest the blue-ribbon seat of Kooyong back from the teals, has pitched herself as a renter and someone who empathises with tenants’ struggles.

But this masthead can reveal that while the Oxford-educated 31-year-old is renting in Hawthorn, she is a landlord and owns two investment properties – a million-dollar flat in inner London and an apartment in Canberra, both bought in the past decade.

UK Property Title documents obtained by this masthead show Hamer purchased a flat in Wandsworth, south-west London, in June 2017 for £635,000 ($1.07 million at the time). Online price estimate websites suggest the property is now worth £679,000 ($1.46 million).

The property is listed online as a one-bedroom, one-bathroom flat, but Hamer was seeking to rent the property out as a two-bedroom flat in 2020 for £1600 a month (about $3000 at the time), according to public Facebook posts in a group for flat shares in London.

In the post, from June 2020, Hamer said she was “stuck in Australia so am renting out my 2 bed ground floor flat for the foreseeable future”.

“The first double bedroom is a good size and leads directly on to the garden. The second bedroom is very small but has a double bed and lots of storage,” she wrote.

“You’ll be dealing directly with me so no letting agent fees etc.”

When approached with a list of questions by this masthead about her London property, Hamer responded with a two-sentence statement that revealed the existence of another property she owns in Canberra.

“While working in London and Canberra, I took out mortgages to buy the apartments that I lived in,” Hamer said in the statement.

“Now that I’m back living in Melbourne, I am renting in Hawthorn.”

She did not respond to a question about why she had not disclosed her home ownership when publicly discussing renting and housing affordability.

Hamer, who is challenging Kooyong independent MP Monique Ryan in the May 3 election, is the grandniece of former Victorian premier Sir Rupert “Dick” Hamer.

Her campaign has won the support of billionaire trucking magnate Lindsay Fox, who was friends with Sir Rupert. Fox has erected a campaign poster of the local Liberal candidate [on his Toorak home’s wall](https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5li68).

According to Hamer’s LinkedIn profile, she worked in Canberra in the federal parliament as a policy adviser to then-cabinet minister Jane Hume between January 2021 and July 2022. Between 2014 and 2020, Hamer was living in London and worked for Bank of America and investment firm DST Global.

A spokesman for Hamer confirmed the Canberra property was being rented out.

[A profile of Hamer ](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/oxford-educated-renter-brings-millennial-edge-to-kooyong-battle-20240326-p5ff8y)in the *Australian Financial Review* last year, titled “Oxford-educated renter brings Millennial edge to Kooyong battle”, described Hamer as “a renter wanting to get into the housing market”.

On the [*Today Show* in June,](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7yelnSy1bT/?igsh=eG1oa29qcW44NWw2) when talking about the rising cost of living, she said: “I know my rent has gone up significantly – I’m a renter.”

*The Age* last year described Hamer as a [“Millennial finance professional who rents”](https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5fg33).

Her campaign emphasises making home ownership more achievable for young Australians with the Liberal’s policy pledge to allow young people to access their superannuation for a home deposit.

Recently on 3AW, while railing against the Victorian government’s plan for [higher density around Kooyong,](https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5fduu) she spoke about the plight of young Australians, who she said felt like “it doesn’t matter how hard I work, it doesn’t matter what I do, I’m never going to have that same quality of life that my parents had”.

In the same interview, she said people did not want to live in apartments and spoke of the Liberal Party’s pledge to bolster infrastructure in greenfield growth suburbs rather than densify the inner city.

The revelation of Hamer’s investment property portfolio is likely to be seized on by Ryan, who is fighting to retain Kooyong with an unhelpful seat boundary redistribution that has pulled her margin to 2.2 per cent.

Ryan owns one property, in which she lives, according to her [parliamentary ](https://www.aph.gov.au/-/media/03_Senators_and_Members/32_Members/Register/47P/OR/RyanM_47P.pdf)register of interests.

The campaign in Kooyong got off to a dramatic start even before a poll date was officially announced when Ryan’s husband, [Peter Jordan](https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5llxe), was filmed removing a Hamer campaign sign from a Camberwell nature strip last month, claiming it was illegally placed.

My partner grew up in Kew where the Hamers are apparently very well known and loaded as fuck. 


Can't believe the dishonesty and ingenuity of Amelia masquerading as a ""poor renting millennial"" and the gall of the Liberals to believe the scores of educated young voters in Kooyong would fall for it. 


I reckon Ryan extends her margin.

I've sent this to everyone I know that lives in Kooyoung. Putting this young woman with a famous name in to try and get Monique Ryan out, and then lying about her background to entice younger voters struggling with cost of housing. It's so cynical and outrageous by the liberal party. They should be punished for this by Kooyoung voters

Just like how she lied about her financial image, she’ll lie about her social image. I wouldn’t be surprised if she joins the Hard Right faction of the Liberal Party and tries to become Australia’s Alice Weidel.

The thing that gets me about this kind of stuff is just... why? Why lie about this kind of stuff? You can be a landlord and still advocate for the renters, you might be lying your ass off when doing so, but pollies do that all the time. Just spin it as luck or something.

Lying about this kind of stuff is just dumb, and you have to know reporters are out there about to give you a colonoscopy so there is a very good chance you'll get caught and have your entire run blown up...

Parenting,let kids be kids campaign,We cut down on TV and wow,"My 7yo son with language development delays has always had... Issues, especially in school. About 3 weeks ago, there were so many incidents the school reported to us in a couple of days, that we decided to cut out TV almost entirely as a wake up call to him, and video games entirely. I should specify he was only allowed TV for about an hour a day on weekdays, and his Nintendo Switch on weekend mornings, not during the week. Right now there's no Switch at all, and we've watched a couple of movies and short documentaries together, but no TV shows. 

I'm struggling to find out if it's made a difference in school at all. Historically, the school will sort of let me believe things have much improved for a long while, and then launch a phone and email campaign where actually, he's been unsufferable the entire time but they haven't been telling me, and then back to radio silence while I try to touch base with everyone and get nothing back. That's a whole thing, but TLDR, his grades are well above average, but his emotional maturity is low for his age and he's... very argumentative with adults and other kids. He has a speech therapist and a psychoeducator.

But at home right now it's like I have a whole different kid. He's always liked to read, but now I have to keep him out of my comic books and hand him what's age appropriate. He gets his dad to take him out skating in the evenings, he's excited to go out, he's taking out toys he's ignored forever, he cleans up after himself, he asks me questions and then actually listens to my answers... In fact he's clearly more able to follow what videos he does watch, too. He occasionally asks about more TV but he's not that invested in the answer, it seems. I thought he would be stubborn but he just moves on. Previously, when I shut off the TV on the weekend, he'd hang around whining, or immediately try to dive for the Switch. He would mope in the evenings after TV and then panic when it was bedtime because he 'hadn't done anything'.

I was letting him watch that hour of TV a day because I had observed that he wanted to detach around school, and he found TV shows very soothing. But clearly I need to reassess everything.

We became a screen free house three years ago at ages 6 and 9 due to terrible behavior, emotional outbursts, inability to do imaginative play and focus other related issues. It was an immediate night and day difference for the better. 

Our kids now read non-stop, beg to go outside to play and are generally awesome kids to be around. We've recently had multiple parents in our kids friend circle come to us and ask for tips on how to cut the cord for the same reasons.
---
Similar! On dark and cold winter evenings I was more lax about the TV going on while I made dinner. I forget why I stopped that,  it now TV isn’t allowed until after dinner, shower and reading is done. For the first couple weeks a lot of “I am bored* etc” but soon enough they figured it out and played or did arts and crafts, and stopped asking for TV.  It lead to a calmer evening overall, and somehow more acceptance when it’s time to turn the TV off to get into bed (and read).

*fixed typo!
---
We have a family friend with an almost 4 year old who watches tv or his iPad from the time he wakes up until he goes to bed. They even put his highchair in front of the tv for meals or hand him an iPad or a phone to watch while they eat. He’s super delayed and I honestly think it’s due to the tv. He’s finally speaking more because his new daycare was saying how behind he was and wouldn’t let him advance up so she got him in a special daycare that works with kids who are behind. He’s been that addicted to the tv too since he was like 6 months. I’m not anti screen time but I think all day having a screen in front of you isn’t good and parents don’t realize that. I see kids in grocery stores of all ages sitting in a shopping cart watching shows on a phone. Parents now don’t let kids just be bored.

SocialMedia,young people and social media ban,Has Social Media ended for millennials? ,"I have never been much of a content creator, but I  could always count on instagram or facebook to keep track of (aka Facebook creep) people from high school.  (Class or 2007).   As the year turns I just had some random nostalgia of old fiends from high school that I haven't seen in years and was curious what they were up to....sort of surprised to see most of them haven't posted on either side in a couple years....it just struck me how I really didn't need a 10 year reunion because I knew what everyone was doing, and now, I am kind of wishing to know how old friends are doing.  Not the good friends that I have stayed in touch with, but sort of the one off-drinking buddies or class mates, etc.   has anyone else noticed this?  I know Facebook has been dieing in the millennial generation for years, but now it seems like instagram is on the outs (I hardly ever used it anyway), and I don't see a switch en masse to another site (like AIM, to MySpace, to Facebook, to instagram, etc.). So basically....is social media among those of us who created it?   I know gen-z has their own approach (with tick-toc) and boomers have taken over Facebook.  

EDIT:

This blew up way more than I expected.   Some really interesting perspective.  I think what it comes down to it social media has changed.  Many people have drawn the conclusion that millennials have ""outgrown"" social media, but I think the more accurate perspective is that social media isn't what it was.  It was an extension of our real life social networks, and a great way to connect with friends.  In college it created a new and exciting way to connect that carried over to the first several years of adulthood.  Over time, that experience has changed.   The current version of social media is content sharing and sites are bloated with ads....there isn't a site that fills that void as far as I can tell, and if there was it would need to have explosive growth to reach the scale needed to keep people interested and posting.   Basically, I have to say, this had made me nostalgic for the old times and will say I am much more likely to attend a high school reunion, should one be scheduled.  To me that is the story of social media, millennials created it,  used it, and then it evolved away to a more economically efficient version of itself.

I’ve turned 30 and noticed a lot of my peers use social media less. Tbh I don’t think it’s great for your mental health. You only see highlights of people’s lives and people lie a lot to look successful. I’ve found a lot of happiness just focusing on my own life.
---
I blame the fact that we all joined various social networks before they got shit and as they declined, we never joined new ones.
---
People post less because overtime social media become more of a means of entertainment than keeping up with friends. My social media feeds used to be just friends, but now it’s clogged up with “content creators” who have schedules for when they post and follow the algorithms. Half of them I don’t even follow but are thrown on my feed to keep us hooked on the app. Basically social media is the new TV. Not just that, but also replaced websites. I listened to an interview with the current head of Instagram and he openly talked about how the focus on the app in now content creation and not a social network like Facebook was in the 2000s.

Social media changed when smartphones took over. With Facebook, it was easier to engage when it was just about friends and you were on a desktop computer. Then when apps like Instagram (as well as Snapchat) took off, everyone started using them on their phones more than the website. Now there was more competition for your attention, so they become more focused on entertainment to keep you on the app longer. That’s when social media became about doom scrolling and ‘influencers’, when before it was about your friends. 

I also understand why so many performers and influencers shifted their focus towards social media as their main platform. Instead of auditioning for TV shows or movies, you can just record a video on your phone and rack up millions of views.

There’s more money is social media as entertainment platforms than social network platforms, and companies like Meta will crush any sort of competition that might pop up. 

I was born in mid-90s so I’m right on the cusp of Millennial and Gen-Z, it’s been sad how these apps have taken over lives. So many people I talk to rarely post anymore, but they still use Instagram everyday and scroll for those quick dopamine hits. ",2024-12-23 21:28:36,False
SocialMedia,kids off social media,I'm a Social Media Manager and I'm glad TikTok it getting banned.,"For the past three years I've been managing the social media for a ski shop and I'm happy that TikTok is being banned. This year I've done a lot of reading and reflecting on the negative impacts of social media, the app is terrible for our mental health and attention spans, especially teen's whose brains are still developing.

The past three years I've also noticed negative changes to other social media platforms as a result trying to compete with the addictive model of TikTok. Its influence has made social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook even worse with the FYP replacing the main feed of people you follow. Now Instagram and Facebook feeds more resemble a FYP than when they focused primarily on friends and pages you follow. Though social media is my job, this past year I've stopped using my personal accounts, as these platforms have become more addictive and have lost much of their social value. My Facebook feed is now almost entirely pages I don't follow, with my Instagram feed being very similar.

Sure, I'm going to miss posting a video on TikTok and having it get thousands of views in hours as opposed to other platforms, but I also know the algorithms that are pushing our videos and damaging to our attention spans and mental health.

Parenting,social media age restriction Australia,Our living room TV died and we aren't replacing it,"3 weeks ago our living room 65"" TV stopped working. Our two girls aged 4 and 6, like most kids, love watching TV, cartoons, movies etc. Many parents battle with screen time, trying to find the balance of TV and other devices etc. We would restrict TV watching as much as possible as our kids definitely got addicted easily and we saw a decline in their focus and behaviour over time. They would maybe watch 30mins to 1hr a day (if that) but more on the weekends. We would always try and sway them to watch documentaries, nature shows and not rapid context switching cartoons etc.

When the TV stopped working, the kids went through a few days of remorse. We live in a beautiful country hinterland part of Australia with a huge garden and massive backyard. After about three days, we were planning on buying a new TV to replace it. But my wife and I had an idea to simply, not replace it. We waited about a week and the girls stopped asking to watch TV altogether. They would just come home from school and run around outside, catch insects and bugs, climb trees etc. And now we've replaced the TV on the wall with a large painting. Under the painting is their craft table with paper and lots of pencils they use.

I still have a 50"" TV in my office, mainly reserved for sport and gaming that I rarely use when the kids are asleep. They don't ask to watch that either. Sometimes we let them have a movie night and watch it together as a family. We do this maybe twice a month.

privacy,Online Safety Amendment Act 2024,MADD is pushing 24/7 face scanning in all new cars,"Mothers Against Drunk Driving snuck a requirement in the 2021 Infrastructure bill that all new cars have ""passive monitoring"" of drivers in an effort to prevent drunk driving. How do they propose we do that? Why, always-on psychometric cameras of course!

Here's a picture of the happy, safe future they're pushing us into: https://madd.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/img-2-1.jpg

The privacy, hacking, and corporate surveillance problems with this seem obvious.

They're asking their supporters to [""Tell the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration why this tech is important to you.""](https://madd.org/haltact).

I just submitted a comment. This is what I said:

> I'm writing to register dissent AGAINST the proposed passive-monitoring systems in cars, pushed by MADD and other organizations as part of an anti-drunk-driving initiative (The ""HALT Act"").
> 
> In this case the cure is worse than the disease. MADD proposes pointing always-on face scanning surveillance cameras at the 233 million licensed drivers in the USA, monitoring our facial features and expressions and feeding them into computers. MADD repeatedly assures us this can be done ""without compromising privacy,"" ""preserving the driver's privacy,"" etc., but in doing so they're making promises that simply can't be kept. Ask any cybersecurity expert: it is a statistical certainty that over time major flaws will be found and exploited in these systems. One needs only to look at the daily major cybersecurity incidents across the globe, including in cars. Subjecting citizens to this level of surveillance is historically unprecedented, and will end very badly.
>
> That's only to speak of unintentional vulnerabilities: accidental release of this extremely sensitive biometric and psychometric data. What, too, of the intentional collection of this data by car companies? ""Passive monitoring systems"" would be connected to other parts of the computer systems in cars. In their ""Monitizing Car Data"" report, McKinsey estimates the value of data generated by cars to be $450-750 billion by 2030, and car companies already collect and sell huge amounts of data on American drivers. The U.S. government should not be mandating collection of this exploitable sensitive data.
>
> The government should not open Pandora's box. Requiring passive psychometric monitoring would be akin to fighting cybercrime by mandating all computers come with always-on surveillance cameras.
>
> Note if, instead of passive monitoring, there were a breathalyzer installed on the steering wheel, these privacy concerns would not exist. MADD seems to be pushing something that they feel will be more palatable to consumers, but it's only palatable because they're being either intentionally or unintentionally dishonest about our biometric and psychometric data remaining private.

The founder actually [left the organization](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/vfg9h/til_that_the_founder_of_madd_left_her/) over this shift in focus.

Parenting,young people and social media ban,My daughter's boyfriend has been stealing from us,"I'm so out of depth in this situation. Sorry this post is going to be long I'm just trying to get my thoughts out. What I'm able to put in a post is only half of the story with this kid, this situation has just been getting worse and worse.

I have 3 children: an 18-year-old son, 16-year-old daughter, and 10-year-old son.

About a year and a half ago my eldest son befriended a boy I'm going to refer to as Max (17). Max didn't go to my son's school, and he was always vague about how he and Max became friends. After Max was introduced to us, he suddenly seemed to be around our house all the time. It also became fairly obvious that my daughter had a crush on Max and 5 months ago I found out they were dating. My daughter was only 15 at the time whereas Max was already 17.

I'd always tried not to be judgemental about Max and for the most part I felt bad for him as he clearly came from a bad home and didn't have a lot of money. It was strange to me that a boy like Max would befriend my son as they seemed like the would be in different social circles. Max is confident and mature. He initially struck me as very polite and generous, despite the fact when I overhear him talking to mine and other kids, he is very vulgar with his language and topics of conversation. There was always something about him that put me on edge. 

He never answered any personal questions about himself and when he did, he would lie (as we would find out later). It wasn't until he started dating our daughter that we found out his parents aren't in the picture, and he lives with an older brother. He also lied about where he went to school, he said in a different town, but I once saw him in a store during school hours and after asking why he wasn't in school, he claimed to be homeschooled. 

I could easily write a whole essay about how uncomfortable my daughter's relationship with Max has become but I want to get to the point. 

We started to notice that Max was maybe taking food about a year ago. Neither my husband or I wanted to say anything because we didn't want him to feel uncomfortable and felt if a teenager is taking food, they probably need it. Going forward I noticed some other stuff going missing. But it still wasn't anything even remotely expensive. Both my husband and I had our suspicions, but we never saw anything that we could concretely say he was doing it. All our kid's friends hang out at our house, and it could have been anyone of them. 

Back in May, one of our chefs knifes went missing. We looked everywhere for it, grilled our kids and turned our whole house upside down. But it was just gone. My husband was fuming and was certain Max had taken it. The next time Max came to our house he accused him, and they argued about it. Max seemed really hurt and baffled that my husband would accuse him. He left and we didn't see him for a while. At that point I genuinely believed Max hadn't taken it and a couple weeks later it turned up in a drawer that we had definitely checked multiple times. Max hadn't been in our house that entire time.

7 weeks ago, my husband and I went away for a weekend, and we allowed our teens to have a small party. They'd had parties in the past without much of an issue. Looking at the ring camera things seemed fine at first. A bunch of kids arrived between 7 and 9, I recognized almost all of them. However, things changed at 11 when I noticed a lot more kids seemed to start turning up, one of them was Max and he had about 10 kids I'd never seen before with him. Around midnight my neighbour texted telling me things seemed to be a little crazy at our house. I called my brother and asked if he could swing by and make sure everything was alright, he brought a couple of his buddies with him. 

Things were apparently pretty intense when he got there, and my son was actually happy to see him. They shut down the party and told everybody to go home. He went looking for my daughter and found her in her room with Max and few of his (male) friends. My daughter was drunk and there was cocaine on my daughter's desk. (She later claimed it was just the boys doing it and brother agreed she didn't seem high). After my brother entered the room, he ended up getting into a physical fight with Max where he had his head slammed against the wall. 

We obviously had lots of conversations with our kids when we got home. My son essentially blamed the whole escalation of the party on Max who he claimed told a bunch of people my son didn't even know about the party. He said he tried confronting Max, but he threatened him, and he was worried what Max would do if he tried to get people to leave. It was at this point our son spilled a whole lot of information about Max we didn't know about. 

He doesn't go to any school because he ran away from his legal guardian (his grandpa) to live with his barely adult brother at 15. Apparently, his mom committed suicide. My son says he was taking stuff from our house and did steal the knife but asked our son to put it back so he could start coming around again. As my son kept talking, he said he felt like he accidently joined a cult when he became friends with Max and that Max is friends with a bunch of older guys at least one of which sells drugs.

At this point Max was obviously banned from our house for good and although our son happily agreed never to see him again it was different with our daughter. We've tried to get her to understand why we don't want her seeing him and, in the end, we've had to keep an uncomfortably close eye on where she's going and whose she is seeing. 

A week ago, my son came home with a bruise on his chin. He said Max had shown up at the birthday party he was at. They got into an argument and then a physical fight. 

Yesterday, after my son came home from school, he noticed his PS5 was missing. He called me to ask if his dad or I had taken it. When I came home to check, nothing else was missing just the PS. It doesn’t look like anybody broke in and we had a lot of other valuably things laying about that were left alone. When my husband came home, we agreed that we thought it was Max. 

My husband wants to contact the police but for right now he hasn’t. Although (hopefully) my daughter hasn’t seen Max in a while they are definitely still together as my daughter messages and calls him constantly. She was hysterical at the idea of us contacting the police. 

I don’t know what to do. This whole situation is such a mess. I want to do what’s right for everybody, including Max, but I have no idea what that is. I want Max out of my kid's lives but at the same time my heart hurts for him.",443,170,WaveFederal9958,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1fbkyd9/my_daughters_boyfriend_has_been_stealing_from_us/,2024-09-08 00:06:06,"r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

Do not wait to take action against Max. He physically assaulted your brother and your son. I can’t even imagine what could’ve happened to your daughter had your brother not shown up. COCAINE?! Your daughter in a room surrounded by older guys? Hell no. I feel bad that Max has been dealt a shit hand, but that gives him no right to use your family as a punching bag or pawn shop. I would involve the police and get a protective order. I would get a therapist to hopefully talk to your daughter about how someone that loves her would never make her steal or put her in risky situations with inebriated men. This situation is extremely hard but your family has certainly tried to do enough for this kid, and it’s clear he only wants to keep taking.
---
I know this is extreme but Max sounds high risk for trying to turn your daughter out. I'd make sure she knows the signs of tht sort of behavior, cause it starts with boundary pushing and typically trying to get her using drugs, or, ""I owe so and so, he's going to kill me. He said if you just do this for him then it would save my life.""

* Just wanted to add if you have guns, even in a safe, they need to be somewhere your son and daughter don't know about or can access. Gun theft is pretty rampant
---
Just a feeling, having had two teenaged daughters with sketchy boyfriends: she took the PS5 and gave it to Max. He probably owes someone money

Babe you gotta call the cops and just deal with your daughter’s emotional fall out. I understand your hesitations but the situation has become to risky for your daughter for you to not go nuclear tbh. This guy is clearly charismatic and clearly has her under his spell and she’s only going to *watch* people do cocaine a couple of times before max is pressuring her to try it. He’s grooming her for worse for lack of a better word.

Futurology,Albanese social media ban,What's your take on AI created content flooding ALL social media platforms?,"I think it was yesterday, someone figured out how to clone voices with only 2 seconds of material, using a variation of SD. With things like magic animate and the new SDXL turbo, anyone can create realistic animated humans dancing to whatever trend. You can even be anyone, dance in front of a camera, and turn yourself into whatever else. **Last year AI content looked fake, videos were unthinkable, so it was quite different.** 

What have we learned from LLMs? Well, **AI generated content has flooded even the Amazon store,** where countless farms produce 'colouring books' and 'children stories'. It's AI-ception, with a research paper out one morning, implementations in the afternoon, *and a full blown SaaS model the day after*. Don't bother thinking about being innovative - if you can think it, it already exists (I tried).  
***I use AI for ethical purposes in the medical space, but I'm no fool - i can tell this is going to get abused.***

Given that platforms such as Insta or TikTok aren't banning AI, I don't see any future where rapacious 'creators' won't bombard these services, but instead of low quality spam easily picked up by Bayesian filters, this will be undisguisable from reality. You could even set up a few local AI agents to schedule the posting at the most optimal time, hold simultaneous real time cam convos, etc. Everything we have learned to hate, but on a scale that wasn't even considered last year. 

In an even more worrying development, I spotted tons of AI generated content on bing and google. Detection on text doesn't work (it's a myth) and now models are trained on content that was created by AI and pulled by spiders. It's worrying to me because **i saw blatantly incorrect and even very dangerous medical content** being pushed by bing chat, and it's chat gpt 4 behind the wheel as i'm sure you know -the 'best' model.  It's a matter of time.

First, WHO is telling them to take up this weird “motivational speech” tone in their writing? It seems every essay I get begins with some broad, general “hook” statement that’s using a bunch of words  but effectively meaningless. Or the kind of manipulative rhetorical question that opens up an advertisement. 

They use extremely bold and provocative language with no justification or argument for it and are constantly making extremely general claims. 

They have no concept of media-literacy or research and don’t know how to find information and most essays dodge the objectives and the students just write these personal essays about their opinion on the topic.
Students will site blatant advertisements from the top of google search as academic sources. 
 It’s like they simply cannot effectively comprehend or communicate ideas through written language. 

 who is teaching them these strange writing conventions!?!

Also, since they do not read (protest at having to read even 5 pages of difficult text) they don’t actually know that good writing is. My theory is that all they’ve read in their entire lives is advertising copy. 

People complain about classes like English and History being a waste of time and having no real world applications but here is the proof: young adults are now functionally illiterate and seem to lack the most basic critical thinking and problem solving skills.

COVID destroyed kids' high school careers recently. Standards were dropped and kids were just passed along. Of course, we all know (well, those of us that work in education) that standards are a fucking joke to begin with so ""bad"" just became ""worse."" And why would you expect the average student to have any sort of media literacy or understanding of research?

I’m a high school English teacher, essentially my job is to get students college and career ready. It’s a rough scene. I have many students that can’t use punctuation correctly. Out of my seniors, I have one who I am confident will move onto college with enough skills to be successful. The problems I’ve noticed are first are foremost, their reading levels are so SEVERELY lacking. So it’s really hard to teach a class of students the grade appropriate standards that would get them ready for college. I have freshmen that are testing at a third grade reading level. Secondly, it’s almost impossible to get them on grade level because they won’t fucking read. Their attention spans are non-existent. So not having reading skills makes writing very hard, and writing, like reading requires a lot of time and concentration. I give my seniors very structured writing assignments where each task is broken down, in hopes that working all those small parts little by little will turn into a good product at the end. Nope. They dick around on their phones during all the time I give them, and rush to finish an essay which is essentially shit. It’s really sad. Teachers are doing their best (for the most part), but just like you, we’re facing an uphill battle.

https://old.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/17cg1vf/been_fighting_it_for_years_but_i_simply_cannot/k5qdcmm/

The Ivy League Columbia University recently had to shut down their famous education professor Lucy Caulkins' literacy program, a popular program that's been mandated in many school districts across America, including one of the biggest districts/NYC. They had no choice because after decades, these progressive teaching methods left many kids functionally illiterate, unless their families/parents could either afford an expensive tutor to teach literacy the traditional phonics way, or their parents had enough money to stay home and tutor their own kids outside of school hours.

A couple of weeks ago my son (2nd grade) brought home a paragraph he wrote in school. Here is an edited version—I’ve fixed his spelling to make it readable but left capitalization and punctuation as he wrote it:

“the wind is strong today which means it’s time to learn so let’s get into it so let’s go! I bet we know what wind feels like in case you don’t know what it feels like here is a recap wind feels like two different things one of them being soft and the other one is hard wind let’s talk about the soft one soft wind is not dangerous in fact it feels good now let’s learn about hard wind and it is dangerous! it is so dangerous because it will throw you in the sky”

To be clear, this is progress from the very minimal writing he/his class were doing this time last year, and I certainly wasn’t writing flawless prose in second grade myself, but…this is not okay! Kid is a big YouTube fan and we’ve vetted his channels and videos, but our first step was to start scaling back his weekend vid time—even normal tv is better than this weird clickbait-y narration. The second step was to apply a small amount of pressure on his reading habits—in my opinion a second grader should mainly be reading for pleasure outside of school, so he‘s been choosing his own books. Almost all of them are graphic novels, but he’s invested and enjoying them and asks for new books, which up to now has been the goal. Now, he still gets graphic novels, but he also has to pick out one prose book per library/bookstore trip, on the grounds that he needs to see prose written down in paragraph form to help him internalize what properly formatted sentences and paragraphs should look like. 

The next problem is spelling—this kid has never made below an 80 on a spelling test, but almost every word in that paragraph was misspelled. Most of his spellings were roughly phonetic, which makes me think he was visualizing what he would say to explain wind to someone and then writing down what he “heard” without worrying about anything except getting the words on paper. If that’s the case, then probably experience and practice will take care of it, but given the very limited writing he’s done in school so far, I think I’m going to need some writing prompts to give him over the summer. (In which case, we should probably also practice “answering the prompt” because I can’t imagine what kind of question prompted the paragraph above.)

But the most terrifying part of all is that I started this school year teaching middle school English, and despite my concerns about my son’s writing… it’s almost on par with what my sixth and seventh graders were producing.",2024-03-20 18:29:11,False
australia,Online Safety Amendment Act 2024,Any Coles or Coles Liquor employees here? What do you think about the shitty proposed 2024 EA?,"Coles has decided to update the EA for Coles (2017) and Coles Liquor (2014) after push from the union and a rocky bargaining exchange. Employees get to vote in favor or against the new EA from the 18th-24th of March. Which ever gets the majority vote wins. If it wins, then it's sent through to the FWC to finalise. All wages-paid employees get to vote, but it's not compulsory and takes place through an independent online provider. Coles understands how the cost of living is heavy on not only their customers, but also their employees. So they've made sure to upgrade the 2024 EA accordingly.

&nbsp;


I’m a level 1 Senior sales assistant at Liquorland, which is the highest level after AM and ASM. I’m on a 20hr part-time contract and have been with the company for nearly 5 years. I made $26.59/hr when I was hired late-2019 as a casual. Got a contract in March 2022 and made $25.67/hr. I currently make $27.92/hr, so a $2.25 increase over 2 years.

&nbsp;

The new EA will cover both supermarkets and liquor instead of separately like it is now. My employee classification will change to Level 3. The only thing it changes for me is the payrate which is decreased to $26.28 which is $1.64 less. Level 2 (now level 1) will have a $1.41 decrease.
The current level 2’s will receive their next Annual Wage Review with a deduction of 0.5% to align their pay rate to those who are employed after the agreement.

&nbsp;

For me and other current level 1’s, we will keep our current pay rate. Instead of a AWR deduction, we won’t receive any annual pay raise until the 2024 rate matches or exceeds our preserved rate. Depending on what the AWR awards, we might not receive any wage increase until at least July 2026.
For us full and part-time employees, we will also have a 25% decrease in our public holiday hours. Casuals also have a PH decrease, but they have an increase in all their other penalties and ordinary pay. These might not seem significant, but it adds up quickly.

&nbsp;

The $1.64/hr decrease turns into a $32.89/wk decrease, and that turns into a $1700/yr decrease. That’s not even fair for the new employees who will be hired after the EA begins.

&nbsp;

To keep it simple, let’s say my shifts are 6 hours, so no break. I work most public holidays and I’m in QLD, so there’s around 11 of them. The 25% decrease in penalties results in $461.35 less a year. We’re closed on Christmas Day so employees who are usually rostered on that day are paid for their shift at their ordinary rate. Under this new EA, we lose that entitlement, as well as the choice to change the payment for an additional day off, or an extra day of annual leave. I’m now out another $168. 

&nbsp;

Now, don’t hold your horses before they hatch. This isn’t some selfish, greedy, inhumane move from Coles – that would be completely out of character. Coles understands just how tough the cost of living has become, and out of the goodness of their hearts, we will receive a Coles gift card. Excluding salaried employees, FT will get $600, PT gets $250, and Casuals get $150.

&nbsp;

^Terms ^and ^conditions: ^One-off ^digital ^gift ^card ^is ^only ^available ^if ^the ^majority ^of ^team ^members ^cast ^a ^vote ^approving ^the ^EA. ^Can ^only ^be ^used ^at ^Coles ^supermarkets. ^4 ^years ^expiry. ^Not ^redeemable ^for ^cash ^or ^other ^gift ^cards.

&nbsp;
‎ 
Don't be mistaken, this isn't a bribe or incentive to vote yes, this is a selfless act of generosity. Coles' Head of Employee Relations and Compliance at Coles, Robert Rondinelli, clears this up: 

&nbsp;
‎ 
>""We reject the unfortunate use by RAFFWU of the term ‘bribe’, when referencing the digital gift card in your Counter-Offer. The digital gift card in our view does put real money into the pockets of our eligible team members to relieve some of the cost-of-living pressures and assist team members purchase food and grocery items for themselves and/or their families. Used in conjunction with the team members’ mycoles discount card, our team receive a genuine financial benefit and we are committed to maintaining it as one component of our Offer""

&nbsp;
‎ 

And regarding the increase of cost of living and Coles' remorseful and unavoidable price inflation, Chief Executive Officer, Leah Weckert, corrects Australians in their misunderstanding of company profit:

&nbsp;
‎ 
> For every $100 a customer spends at Coles, we make $2.60 in profit. This represents less than 3 cents in the dollar. The remaining $97.40 of that $100 the customer spends is paid in costs and tax. Now, 80% of the profits that we make don't stay with us. They are paid to our shareholders, the majority of whom are Australian mom and dad investors or retirees… So when we pay that money back to shareholders, it's going to people across Australia to fund their retirement and pay their bills. And for the remaining profit, what's left at the $2.60 after we pay our dividends, well, that goes into investment in our business.”

&nbsp;
‎ 

This shit sucks. And I know that the vote will go through. They’ve put so much emphasis on the gift cards and purposefully excluded the significant changes that will negatively affect us on infographics both in team rooms and online. [Coles Liquor](https://imgur.com/RpVYuf8) and [Coles Supermarket](https://imgur.com/ie7B7jA). Now, this is confidential, employee-only information, so don't go sharing this around on the internet!

&nbsp;
‎
Anyway, fuck coles and fuck all the morbidly obese fat cats at the top who wouldn't even know how to reprint a receipt.

TL;DR: New ELB for Coles and Coles Liquor Employees. Wage cuts, Penalty cuts, gift-cards to distract employees. Coles, the poor, independent, and struggling company struggles to make ends meet with the little money they have.

If you work for Coles, please vote no. Even if you aren't affected by the wage cut and are keeping your current wage. The gift card isn't worth it, and it isn't a gift. And if you don't work for Coles, idk what you can do but thanks for reading lol.",387,151,RatInTheCowboyHat,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1bhjp2v/any_coles_or_coles_liquor_employees_here_what_do/,2024-03-18 05:56:58,"Everyone working for ColesWorths needs to give the SDA the flick as they do nothing but help to sell out workers each time a new EBA is negotiated.

I was frankly insulted by them trying to push the return of split shifts as somehow a positive for employees. I fuckin remember years ago when they were raked over the Cole’s for how badly they were abusing split shifts. I can already see rosters degenerating into an indecipherable mess as soon as this agreement (inevitably) goes through. I’m fuckin done with the SDA after this. ‘Union’ has done nothing for us except try and push what’s best for Cole’s.

Talk to as many Coles workers as you can this week. Explain why it’s a bad deal.   A big reason why these things go through is that so many people don’t even know what the EA is, so they see the brochure Coles puts in the staff room and assume its the best it can be based only on that small bit of biased information. 

 They read the bit that says pay increase but don’t understand that it’s dependent on what the FWC decides. They read about us being “above award rates” and, having no real idea what the award is, assume it’s by a significant amount. They read about a gift card and think it’s free money. They don’t see the possible ramifications of split shifts. That it can mean working 7hrs in one day with no paid break. That their managers may be the type to say that if they don’t agree to split shifts, there’ll be no available hours for them.  They don’t know that it’ll mean pay freezes or pay cuts for some people

 So they’ll either vote without knowing all the information about the EA or they just won’t vote at all. Hell, there are many that don’t know there is a vote.

Looks like Liquor gets screwed more by being brought down to the same level after a quick read.  
The Supermarkets gift card is a joke  (Not sure if it can be used for fuel and most people would probably rather use that money on bills ) and seems to be only there since there was a backlash on the cash payment they did last time where they sneaked it in with the normal pay cycle... after a Public Holiday letting tax eat it all up, instead of just doing it seperately.   
Double amount of discount days is a joke too. Just double it to 10% permanently.

  
Like last time the vote will pass because they will escort the junior staff to a computer and tell them which way to vote because its "" in their best interest"" and they know they won't read anything.

It's the same situation with my daughter, she's in grade 5 and most of her friends have TikTok and Snapchat and I honestly do not understand the mentality of their parents. I've explained to her about online safety and predators and thankfully she seems to accept it for now but I worry for those other kids especially because they're displaying some concerning behaviours already.

Every parent needs to read this New York Times investigation before they allow their kids on social media and before they decide to make an account featuring their kids https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/us/instagram-child-influencers.html?unlocked_article_code=1.X00.EeLr.jAJOYatcJzNc&smid=nytcore-android-share The internet has NO regulation and social media platforms do not care about the wellness and safety of your kids. To me, maybe it’s extreme, but it’s a form of neglect to let your kids get on those platforms at such a young age. It’s your job to keep them safe

Edit: also, I pray to god more parents won’t be giving their kids cell phones at such a young age. Those parents are doing everyone a disservice. There are other options for staying in touch with your kids 
---
My son won't even have a phone till he's 14. I find that nuts. Not feeling the pressure yet as he's still small.
---
As a principal at a middle school, and the parent of 10 and 11 year olds, my best advice is wait until 13 for the phone (I know it’s hard). If they need a phone for walking home things like that, bare bones phone or Apple Watch (or flip phone if you’re feeling hardcore).  
However, my observation is this. If you completely ban social media, rather than put more effort into monitoring use, you’re just going to have them find workarounds—comps and vpns, their friends phones to make their own accounts that they access and use while sneaking the phone at school…. We see it daily with some of the not so sharpest tools in the shed. They will figure it out. And you will have no way of monitoring it. 
Use apps to monitor. Take the phone to charge in your room at night. Set time limits. The more restrictive you are the more they’ll find a way. Especially the girls. These are facts I’ve observed since kids have been bringing phones to school (which is literally worse than anything else for these middle school kids). 
Good luck!

ETA: we live in a city where every kid has a phone. My kids do not. My daughter does have an old school iPod touch she uses WiFi for just so she can start to be responsible of a small device and maybe make her feel a little cooler.",2024-02-24 15:32:07,False

---
What if I don't have any? Literally. What if I left this whole mess that is social media, way back in 2010 and deleted everything, never returned, never signed up again? What if I never even created one in the first place? Then what?

Or on the opposite spectrum, what if I have dozens of various accounts, but they're not openly linked to me in anyway. Think Reddit for example. Or a tech forum account. (No need to lecture me about shadow profiles and fingerprinting techniques detecting with an 99.99% accuracy, and using available info from data brokers, I already know all this, check my profile and how many comments and posts I have on this subreddit from over the years, that's not the point. The point is the accounts aren't explicitly, openly and publicly tied to me, aka something like LinkedIn or Twitter with my name on it)

Or do they want to know my NextGenUpdate forum handle from 2010 when I used to buy Call of Duty leveling services? What about my Steam account? Isn't that social media? My Reddit porn alt?

Or is it just the big tech accounts they care about, so they can 1984 you? Twitter, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, etc?

Is it now illegal to not use social media? They are probably laying the foundational work for a mandatory digital ID system, where you'll be required to have a presence in order function in modern society, or at the very least, your accounts will be tied to your actual ID.

Seems like if you don't have a social media handle and leave that part of the form empty, you'll most likely be denied. What a world we live in. This does not concern just the US btw. Nor does it concern the current regime in the US. Think bigger, think about the long run. It affects all of us, as other countries will look at this example and follow suit. You'll be required to have a social media presence, or be labeled a weirdo, an outcast who has something to hide.

""Do you not think of the children and terrorists?""

That's how they get ya.

Edit: Also a small rant about toxic positivity about social media usage. Everyone talks about detoxing from social media, leaving it behind, not engaging with it anymore, etc, to have better mental health and a more peaceful life. They'll lecture you on social media about how leaving social media is healthy for you. But when you do leave social media, these same people who lectured you, will look at you like you're a weirdo. ""Wait, what do you mean you don't actually use social media? Do you have something to hide? So what if they track me, they already know everything.""

I hate this toxic positivity attitude. Stand by your morals. Put your money where your mouth is. If leaving social media is good for your mental health, then don't treat people who actually do leave social media as outcasts. That's hypocrisy at its finest.

Futurology,young people and social media ban,"Little noticed in Western media, China's recently announced space plans may make it the leading power in space by 2030 if carried out to schedule.","I make a habit of following lots of space newsletters & following people who cover space developments on social media. One thing I'm always struck by is the huge blind spot in Western countries to what is happening in China. Here's a good example. It was the 74th International Astronautical Congress in Baku, Azerbaijan a couple of weeks ago. China announced plans, that had anyone other country said they were doing them, would have received huge media coverage. Instead, barely a whisper.

Firstly, they'll have the world's most powerful space-based telescope by 2030. NASA only plans for something as powerful in the 2040s.

Second, they plan to build a deep space communication and transport network as far as Jupiter. This will utilize Lagrange points, and its first components built will be the Earth-Moon leg of it & be before 2030.

Finally, their plans for the International Lunar Research Station are becoming detailed and concrete. Once again, in advance of anything NASA is doing. NASA is relying on the private sector to come up with solutions as it is weighed down by the SLS political mess. This approach may beat China, but right now they have the most advanced plans in place and a definite schedule.

Parenting,young people and social media ban,My kid wants a big tattoo. I don’t want my kid to have lifelong regrets.,"On her 16th birthday, my daughter declared themself non-binary. At 17, they said they wanted a big tattoo on their back and we told them, “Sorry, not legal in Illinois until you’re 18, and we don’t want you to make a decision you regret.”

Today they turn 18. They are finishing high school, and they get straight A’s and got into every college they applied to. They are incredibly socially awkward, all their friends have dropped away, and we did a neuropsychological evaluation at their behest, and on the recommendation of their therapist. They were disappointed to see they weren’t autistic, thinking that would explain everything, and claimed they were masking on the test, providing answers they thought the doctor wanted to hear. Yes, they are an adult as of today, but are not street savvy in any sense and have always been very young for their age in comparison to their peers.

The dream remains: a big MCR – My Chemical Romance – spider tattoo on their back. I said, as a joke, why do you want to put a tattoo in the one spot that you’re the only person in the world that can’t see it? They’ve been pretty obsessed with this band for 2+ years, absorbing all the lore and myth making. I’ve listened to all the music, watched the entirety of The Umbrella Academy series, seen some of the graphic novels. Their creative output is impressive, but also strikes me as music and pop culture artifacts that one would ultimately grow out of, and be happy they did.

My wife and I are not opposed to tattoos, and between us have four small tattoos in out-of-the-way places, marking significant milestones in our lives, but we also got them only starting at about 30.

This is not about wanting to form children in our own image. We have older kids, and we saw that ship sail over the horizon long ago. Yes, in part, I hate to see my kid permanently altar or mar their faultless body for an adolescent pop culture marker. But mostly I want to do what I can to prevent them from making a massive, irreversible decision that they will someday regret. Alternately, they may also permanently adopt a juvenile stance, to justify this adolescent choice. I’ve been thinking how people have to do that ever since I saw a guy in New Zealand with “DIE YUPPIE SCUM“ in the biggest possible Gothic script going across his forehead: he limited his life opportunities massively the day he drew that up, safe to say.

So, how do I either prevent my youngest from making a massively regrettable choice, or how do I somehow make peace with it? 

Thank you for reading. 

Editing to add: 
1.) My 18 year old would be paying for this tattoo on their own. They’ve always been very thrifty and have saved a lot of money, but might be willing to spend as much as $2,000 on a tattoo

I think this is the kind of thing that fixes itself if you have them review artists, really understand the signs of a poor quality artist and get picky about what they want for their own tattoo, and then review the likely cost of a tattoo that large based on the number of hours with a quality artist. I love tattoos but I've been holding off for over a year because I just can't find a artist I'm happy with nearby.
---
I think it’s possible that they regret this tattoo but there’s a bunch of adults who have Harry Potter and Disney tattoos that they don’t regret - a large spider seems less tied to a brand. If it’s on their back, it’s not like a job interviewer will see it and it’s a far cry from having “die yuppie scum” on your forehead. There’s actually plenty of people who have tattoos on more noticeable places - their hands, ankles, etc. and still find work and are respected members of society. The world has really changed in that respect. Any reputable tattoo artist will know it’s your child’s first tattoo and try to talk them down in terms of size but a spider tattoo on a back isn’t a terrible choice for a tattoo.
---
Maybe you could encourage them to get a removable version of it first. I think you can get temporary tattoos custom made, and I think they last for a week or two. I don't know how much it costs, but then they could see it and decide if they really want it. If they decide to still get it though, you'll need to step out of the way and let it happen. And then, if the time comes that they regret it, you'll have to resist the urge super hard to say any form of ""I told you so.""

Parenting,age verification social media Australia,Has anyone read the Anxious Generation?,I’m about halfway through the audiobook and it’s really given me a lot of information on how social media effects teens and tweens brains. Question: what age did you give your children iPhones? I want to wait until at least 15/16 but I feel like we built a world for ourselves that makes this decision impossible. ,341,174,Sea_Drop3263,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1k80pls/has_anyone_read_the_anxious_generation/,2025-04-26 00:53:49,"I teach middle school, so I've thought a lot about this and seen the pitfalls.

Basically, there are two big issues (1) Almost EVERY KID gets a smartphone at the beginning of middle school. Your kid WILL be left out of conversations without at least the ability to text. (2) Giving a kid unrestricted phone use on day 1 of having a phone will be a total disaster regardless of age. You need to TEACH THEM HOW TO USE IT and EASE THEM INTO IT.

So, I think the best strategy is a gradual release of responsibility:

Below 6th grade: No phones. If you must tablet, tablet stays out in public spaces as if it was another TV: no going into the bedroom with it (unless the kid's sick or something). Apps should be heavily restricted- focused on educational games, interactive/multiplayer games that ONLY YOU play with them (think: pass-and-play monopoly), enrichment/meditation/exercise, and longer-form videos (netflix etc). No free internet. Time should be earned and restricted. If they must have a phone to communicate with you, make it one of those non-smart phones (bark, gab, gizmo, etc)

6th-8th: Phone arrives. Preferably one of those non-smart phones with texting, but they'll talk you into an iPhone. Apps stay the same as on the tablet, but texting is allowed (but monitored). Absolutely no Snapchat and no TikTok or other social media. Mayyybe YouTube, if you monitor use. Internet allowed with parental controls/monitoring. Any infractions of expectations (breaking of phone rules, grades dropping) and the phone goes away for a week or more (this is common; don't let them tell you otherwise). If they have repeated infractions, switch to an old-school phone for communicating with you. Parental controls brick the phone during school hours and at night by 9pm.

9th-10th: if they've been good, stop monitoring their usage, but don't allow snapchat/tiktok still. Potentially let up on other social media (but monitor). Still take away phones if they've broken rules. Parental controls brick the phone during school hours and at night by 10pm.

11th-12th, if all has gone well, then give them the freedom they want. See how it goes. If there are issues, go back a step or two.
---
Have you heard of the Gabb phone? It’s essentially like an iPhone but no internet, social media or games. It LOOKS like the real thing, but it’s purely to be used as a phone (call/text). 

We plan on doing something like that when they’re at an age where they’re home alone. But we don’t plan on doing an actual phone until 14/15 unless they are somehow able to buy it and pay for it outright and the monthly bill themselves prior to that!

I’ve read the book and in the mental health field. We’ve always said we would wait for a smart phone and definitely on social media. 
Our kiddo isn’t old enough yet for a phone, but we are trying to find ways for more independence and play.
I have nieces and nephews who are in the tween and teens and the parents gave phones on the earlier side and regret it.
A few parents in our community have signed the Wait Til 8th pledge and hoping we get to the required 10.
I also am reading through the Let Grow website.
Overall, there’s never been great harm with kids having play and independence, but there’s been great harm of social media and online predators. It seems weekly, there are news articles about predators meeting kids online.

I haven't read the anxious generation, but I have read ""Stolen Focus,"" which deals with a lot of similar ideas, as well has listened to some interviews with Jonathan Haidt on the topic. 


One thing Stolen Focus talks about when discussing possible strategies for change is the importance of building a like minded community that supports these types of decisions. Ppl have so much stacked against them in this struggle, and we have morphed into a world where it feels like you cannot restrict certain technology without alienating your child. When you cultivate a community that support and adhere to the same ideas it will make it much easier to enforce/stick with.


Highly recommend Stolen Focus, btw, if you are interested in this topic! It actually had me in tears a few times.

My 14-year-old does not have a phone. It is completely doable. We went full 90s - there is a landline for kiddo to use, we have a computer in the living room, we have an n64, etc;. Kiddo has a rich, full life and in many ways is mentally better off than classmates. 

I'm a teacher. I can tell which kids got social media too early. I can tell which kids have unrestricted screen time. On the other hand, I can tell which kids actually read books or have interests they pursue outside of school. 

I do not think that it is an overstatement to say that the type of screen time you give your kid can ultimately determine the type of person your kid turns out to be. This is from my experience with hundreds of teens. 

Advice: find community with other like-minded families, and send your kid to a school with a bell-to-bell phone ban. They won't be left out of anything during school hours then. Keep your kid busy with stuff that interests them, and give them opportunities to connect socially in person. 

For us, no smartphone until junior year.",2025-04-26 00:53:49,False
Futurology,young people and social media ban,Social media algorithms are built to manipulate us - it won't be long before there is AI doing the same.,"Anthropics' Claude AI was able to guess the name of a person using it, and no one understands how it figured it out.

[Here's the exchange on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gr9pze/claude_35_just_knew_my_last_name_privacy_weirdness/)

This doesn't surprise me. Most people who've spent time online have left vast troves of identifying data on the internet. Most social media companies structure their products so you can't escape being identified. All that data has trained the different AIs.

But have most people woken up to the implications? If AI can identify you, it can psychologically profile you & the next step from that is manipulation. Each of us on a one-by-one basis, with the manipulation tailored to our individual personalities.

Social media algorithms are built to manipulate us - it won't be long before there is AI doing the same. The EU seems to be one of the few places keeping pace with AI regulation, but even it hasn't caught up to the full implications of AI's capabilities.",336,54,lughnasadh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1gsmlb7/social_media_algorithms_are_built_to_manipulate/,2024-11-16 12:49:56,"Social media platform algorithms *are* AI, which are already tailor made to learn our preferences and keep us engaged

I get that it seems like a pedantic point, but it matters here

Are you saying you think LLMs are a danger? Yes, they already are being used heavily to manipulate discussions on social media, pretending to be real people, including right here on Reddit

Or, are you worried about some hypothetical future AI models?

Don’t sensationalize what actually happened to that developer using Claude via the API.

A developer was using an AI tool (Claude-3.5-sonnet) to generate a LICENSE file for their project. They were surprised when the output included their last name, which they believe is quite rare. They’re concerned because they say they never told the AI their last name during that session or before.

Here’s what likely happened: Large language models like this AI don’t “know” personal details about people in the way humans do. Instead, they work by predicting the most likely response based on patterns in their training data. If the developer’s last name is unusual but appears in public content they’ve written—like GitHub repos, blogs, or other public data used to train the AI—it’s possible the model made the connection based on those patterns. Essentially, the prompt the developer used may have been similar to something the AI “saw” in training that included their name, so it suggested their name as part of the response.

In short, the AI isn’t pulling secret information—it’s just connecting the dots in its training data, which likely includes publicly available information about the developer.

Not to say there isn’t a problem here, but let’s not use a misunderstanding of one technology to sensationalize another.

Parenting,young people and social media ban,I think my wife is freaking out too much over our daughters health/weight.,"Edit: cant believe I didnt mention her age anywhere! She is 16

 Both me and my wife are into fitness. Not to an extreme level, but we work out and generally eat healthy. We were very lucky with our son, he right away got into biking and playing soccer/basketball and working out and keeping to a healthy diet. We barely had to encourage him at all, he just naturally fell into it. He was 'buff' as early as 8th-9th grade.

Our daughter is a different story. We have tried to get her into working out, even just basic cardio, but she resists it a lot. We have tried to get her to eat healthier, but it feels like a lost cause, she just buys unhealthy food outside the house. She isn't extremely overweight, but she is 184 lbs at 5'11, up from 168 last year at the same height. She also has effectively zero physical strength as a result of not working out, something which we really saw first hand when we had her help us move my moms furniture out of her apartment. And I mean really not working out at all. She is largely sedentary and doesn't do any exercises whatsoever. We have tried talking to her about it, just saying stuff like, you know, exercise and eating healthy make you feel good, stuff like that. Focusing on the positives.

To me, its somewhat worrying. But to my wife, its cataclysmic. She has been insanely stressed over this, to the point of crying multiple times. She seems to have this mindset that being physically unfit means you are FOR SURE going to be miserable, socially and health wise. She seems to think that if you don't work out and keep fit, you will 100% end up with severe health problems as early as your 20s, and that nobody will want to be friends with you or date you. And it feels like any time I argue with her about this she makes it into a gender thing, that I will never understand how different it is for women in this regard. That I will never truly understand the body-image issues that women go through and how much worse it is to be a fat woman than a fat man (pls, do not start some insanely long debate about this in the comments). I try telling her that people are more accepting than they used to be about weight, and she says yeah, maybe in most of the country, but not in NYC. And she is kind of right on that. I see groups of teens/young adults and almost always the vast, vast majority are fit. People very openly talk about fitness and diet in a way that might seem improper in other places (and we've lived in other places, this isnt just baseless). This is probably the worst place in America to be overweight. And my daughter loves it here, she isn't the type to move away.

Neither me or my wife express this stuff to her. We are both aware of how this can come off to a teenage girl who is likely dealing with body image issues already. We don't want to shame her or anything like that. My wife has said, multiple times, that maybe we should have been harsher on her on this topic. Emphasis on 'harsher' and not 'harsh', she is under the illusion that once you gain weight, its almost impossible to lose. She thinks that she is just going to be that way forever.

Also, just to mention, our daughter has friends. If my wifes theory was correct, shouldnt they have dropped her? She hangs out with her friends multiple times a week.

I think its an issue. But I also think my wife is going a bit overboard with this. It is making her miserable. It seems like sometimes she views our daughter as some kind of lost cause who is destined to be sick and socially ostracized her whole life. She gets sad/upset even just looking at her. She is just going way too overboard with how she views this issue. For one, our daughter is not severely overweight at all. Two, lots of fat women still lead great and fulfilling lives.

I honestly could not have really predicted that my wife would ever have made this a big deal. She never seemed the type to make a big fuss over this, until suddenly she did.

Anyways, how do I even approach this? Its such a weird issue, and again, it feels like my wife shuts my arguments down with the gender argument. That I wont get it, because I am a man.

TL;DR - - daughter has gained some weight, and my wife is in hysterics over it. She is miserable at the idea of our daughter being not physically fit.

Edit: I should mention that my wife is quite averse to therapy. She is originally from the Soviet Union (russia/azerbaijan) and there is a very deep rooted distrust of psychology in that part of the world, even if she mostly grew up in the US. She denies that she has any aversion to it but I can sort of tell that she does. I have brought up multiple times to her that she should seek therapy over this, and she just denies she needs it.",328,442,bakstruy25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1f4b08e/i_think_my_wife_is_freaking_out_too_much_over_our/,2024-08-29 19:21:35,"r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

Your wife needs to sort her shit out. These are her body issues she's projecting onto your kid. She should get some therapy and focus on herself because she is the problem here.

Parenting,young people and social media ban,I fear I have no more patience for dealing with my daughter's break up.,"This is a throwaway. Didn't wanna write anything so personal on my main. 

I'm a 39 year old woman with a soon to be 17 year old daughter who recently went through her first breakup.  Last June. Almost 12 months ago. 

They dated for 6 months, and he broke up with her after the last day of school, and shes laying in the living room crying loud enough for the neighbors to maybe call the cops soon.   It's very performative (I can tell the difference). 

The idea that we're approaching the anniversary of the break-up isn't lost on me,  but this has been a steady problem all year. 

I am not entirely without empathy. I remember when I went through my first break up, I was a nightmare. I remember how world ending it feels. But I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. 

I have spent cumulative hours, likely adding into multiple weeks, being kind and understanding, and trying to talk to her through this. Given all the best break- up advice (delete your old text threads, block him on social media,  spend time with friends, ect), of course none of which she has taken because despite the desire to speed run her to understanding any of this shes gotta figure it all out on her own like everyone does. 

It's thankfully not as bad as it was in the beginning, but still, every now and again, she will see something that upsets her while stalking is social media or something and the cycle continues. Today I just had to tell her that there was nothing new I, or any of her friends could say to help her feel better if she's going to continuously do things that upset her. I said it's hard to feel sorry for someone who keeps intentionally poking the same electrical socket over and over again.  I just sat with her in silence while she cried for another half hour+, screaming and kicking her feet.  It went on until I had to kind of raise my voice a bit to tell her to take some deep breaths, because gently suggesting it didn't help. 

Now I'm just hiding in the bathroom and feeling bad for raising my voice and guilty for feeling so annoyed by this.  


Edit: Since people keep asking, I should add that she has been in therapy before. Not since the break up, but she's gone two different times (not two sessions, two instances where she went, and her case was closed).  She is an extremely smart kid, and besides, seemingly, this one situation , she has very high emotional maturity/intelligence.  Talking to her is like talking to an adult sometimes.  

She periodically struggles with self-esteem, but most of the time, she seems to understand that she is killing it in a lot of aspects of life.  She's a talented artist (illustration, painting, knitting, sewing) and writer,  she gets high test scores, shes the best actor in her school's drama club, and is generally doted on by most adults that meet her that are so impressed by her. 

She's always been a little on the emotional side, but nothing like this at all.  ",324,223,3amCaramelIceCream,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1l02rxa/i_fear_i_have_no_more_patience_for_dealing_with/,2025-05-31 17:35:57,"Welcome to r/Parenting!

She’s kicking her feet screaming and crying over a break up that happened a year ago? This doesn’t seem like a normal reaction to me, even for a 17 year old. Does she have a history of not being able to regulate her emotions? High highs, low lows, that sort of thing? It may be worthwhile to get her into therapy. You are definitely doing all the right things though!
---
This seems like an excessive emotional response for a 17 year old to have over a breakup that was a year ago. Does she see a therapist? 

I could totally be wrong, but it sounds to me like this situation might also be an outlet for her to express big feelings that she has even if they’re unrelated to the breakup. If she knows she’ll get sympathy and love due to this circumstance, it might be a cry for help or attention (not in a bad way!) just when she feels like she needs comfort and love. 

Either way, since it’s been a year and it isn’t getting better, she could absolutely benefit from learning coping mechanisms from a therapist
---
Yo, I would have gotten my little 17 year old drama llama into therapy 8 months ago. 

She's getting some kind of emotional validation from re-hashing this and continuing to try and make people feel sorry for her. I'm surprised if her friends are still paying attention to her theatrics.

She needs a reality check. And some tools to build emotional maturity and resilience. A really good therapist can help.

Is there any other problems besides this one? At home, school, in day to day life? I was a severely depressed teenager with a not so great home life. My, at the time, boyfriend was literally the only emotional support line I had left but I was putting a LOT on him for us being 15. We were together for a year, he broke up with me the day after Valentine’s Day. I had always been suicidal but that was the straw that broke the camels back for me. I took a bunch of my moms expired Xanax but thankfully had the sense to call a friend, who came over immediately & stayed with me the whole time. I ended up hallucinating and having a seizure, leading me to my month stay at a mental institution. All that to say, sometimes it’s more than you’ll ever be able to understand. I’m not saying she’ll take it that far but I’d definitely look into therapy for her. It’s not healthy for her to be feeling like this for as long as she has. I hope things get better soon 🖤",2025-05-31 17:35:57,False
AustralianPolitics,Australia under 16 social media ban,‘Congratulations Peter Dutton’: LNP incorrectly declares leader election debate winner before audience votes for Anthony Albanese | Australian election 2025,"**Albanese won 44 votes out of 100 at the Wentworthville leagues club in western Sydney, Dutton won 35 and 21 people remained undecided**

**Josh Butler, Wed 9 Apr 2025 11.47 AEST**

Official social media accounts for the Coalition declared Peter Dutton the winner of Tuesday night’s leaders’ debate, despite [Anthony Albanese](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/anthony-albanese) winning the support of more undecided voters on the Sky News panel.

Albanese won 44 votes out of 100 at the Wentworthville leagues club in western Sydney, Dutton won 35 and 21 people remained undecided. Neither leader made a major misstep in the Sky News forum and many political commentators described the face-off as a spirited draw.

But multiple social media accounts for the [Liberal National party](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/liberal-national-party) and the Nationals proclaimed Dutton had won the debate, well before the official results were declared by Sky.

The debate finished at 8.30pm on Wednesday – the same time the Coalition released [the long-awaited modelling on its gas plan](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/08/coalition-releases-long-awaited-modelling-showing-energy-plan-could-drive-down-household-gas-bills-by-7), which Dutton had until then declined to discuss in detail. Just three minutes later at 8.33pm, about 40 minutes before Sky announced the official results of the debate, the LNP [posted to its Facebook account ](https://www.facebook.com/LNPQLD/posts/pfbid0hx6bbHkAvgJtdHETcWKQuzVpgoThJZ8oXagxfVcArQBJBGNdrMtae9394xB2mgmAl)“congratulations Peter Dutton”, with a photo of Dutton below with the words “Sky News debate WINNER!”

The LNP – a distinct entity which operates in conjunction with, but separately from, the Liberals and the Nationals – exists in Queensland, Dutton’s home state.

The LNP published the same “WINNER” post and graphic to [its X account](https://x.com/LNPQLD/status/1909556085410939193) and also [on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DILrMrtzGZT/).

The National party of Australia, the junior Coalition partner, also posted [on its Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheNationalsAus/posts/pfbid02wn8oSTcsSYSKGEDJgnkagRCLsPerA2cY6JiHifWYGK6WgwmD9vYdjhpnB2st4EeYl) that Dutton was the “winner of the debate”.

It confused many.

“How was the victory decided? I thought more of the audience picked Albo at the end?” one person on Instagram commented.

“This post was made before any media outlet reported a Dutton victory,” said another.

“Sky News said Albo won?” wrote a third.

Supporters on Facebook praised Dutton’s performance, with one person commenting “No one could dispute the win for Dutton. Albanese looked totally uncomfortable. Dutton was confident and precise.”

“Definitely the winner, Peter called out Albo on his lies,” said another.

But one person also wrote “Sky news literally declared Albo the winner lol”.

The claim that Dutton won the debate was not published on official accounts for the Liberal party.

After 9pm, once the debate result was announced by Sky, Labor’s official national Facebook page posted: “Breaking: Albo has won the first debate with Labor’s plan to build Australia’s future”.

Labor’s Western Australian Facebook page [published](https://www.facebook.com/WALabor/posts/pfbid029UYptew1uNKaQARrc2xVs5LJNpvhoqpaS1D5NQvFBq4NKpdCxkBWosPdfzZsvzT6l) at the same time a graphic stating “ALBO WINS leaders debate”.

Both major parties used the debate to create large amounts of social media content. Labor and the [Coalition](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition) live-tweeted the debate, sharing clips of their leader’s strongest lines, as well as graphics with statistics or policies they wanted to highlight.

The Nationals created a bingo card for the debate, filled with criticisms of Albanese, including a central square with the word “lies”, and another saying “says he didn’t fall off stage” – a reference to a prominent talking point of the Coalition, after Albanese’s stumble at a union rally last week, and a subsequent radio interview where he maintained “I stepped back one step, I didn’t fall off the stage”.

The Liberal party created its own bingo card, accusing Albanese of “lies” and also referencing the stage fall.

Labor published a “verdict from the first leaders’ debate”, contrasting Albanese against Dutton as “calm vs chaos”, “experience vs bad judgement” and “positive vs negative”.

On TikTok, Labor posted a clip of the leaders discussing health and Medicare policy: the video was captioned “omg … Albo calls out Dutton’s record as health minister” followed by three fire emojis.

The Liberal TikTok account posted a video captioned “Albanese caught lying ... again”, as well as a Simpsons meme accusing him of lying.",317,79,Enthingification,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/09/election-leaders-debate-winner-albanese-social-media-posts-congratulate-peter-dutton,2025-04-09 04:15:27,"**Greetings humans.**

Parenting,young people and social media ban,Would you let your child go by a different name?,"My 5 year old daughter has been going by a name other than the one we chose for her for a few months now. We had no problem using this new name, names are personal and we feel like she has the right to be called what she wants. We gave her a fairly uncommon, frilly, older name and she chose a more common short and plain name and it suits her.

Most of our family has been okay with it, aside from the initial shock. But yesterday we celebrated a late Thanksgiving with my brother-in-law and his wife. They have a daughter the same age, and his wife ended up causing a scene. Completely unprompted, she pulls her daughter into the middle of the room where we all were and starts going off about how she better not get any ideas, 5 is too young to make that kind of choice, she's the parent so it's her right to choose their names, etc. She also told her kids they didn't have to respect my daughter's new name because it's not ""real yet"".Every time someone would address my daughter using her chosen name, SIL would roll her eyes and mutter my daughter's given name. 

I really didn't expect this reaction and I feel like it's a little extreme. She's 5, she'll probably eventually go back to her old name, and I don't see the point in pushing the issue and making it a big deal. I've talked to some friends about the incident and they've said that while they're not upset that we let her go by a new name, they personally wouldn't let a child do so until they're an adult. 

I would've never expected anyone to take issue with a simple non-legal name change, and this whole thing has me thinking if our reaction was odd or uncommon. To me it feels no different than allowing a nickanme. I have no judgement for people who wouldn't allow it, but I'd really love some opnions. Would you let your five year old socially (not legally) change their name? Why or why not? Thanks!

Edit: Adding context as it's been brought up in the comments, I do absolutely believe my SILs reaction is related to transphobia. My wife is trans, and my SIL has never been outwardly rude (to her face) about it, but has for sure been weird about it. I think she feels like she'll get a away with bullying a child in a way she knows won't get away with with my wife. I'm also sure she feels like my wife's transition is the cause of the name change. (It's absolutely not.)

Edit 2- Some comments are worried the new name might be ""weird"" or a ""boy name"", but that's not at all the case. For clarity, think going from Genevieve to Emma (not actually the names)",309,308,Mug153,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/184rkhk/would_you_let_your_child_go_by_a_different_name/,2023-11-27 01:58:53,"r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

I would let me kid be called what they wanted. I called my youngest Pizza for a couple days before he got tired of it.

I think anyone has the right to say “I don’t want to be called that” no matter their age and tell you what they’d prefer to be called. There’s really no harm in following her lead.
---
I think this calls for a time out until after the holidays. Your sister in law needs some time to pull herself back together if she’s coming unglued over a name.
---
You’re SIL is being awfully dramatic over a non-issue that doesn’t even affect her life in anyway. 

She’s FIVE, let her be called whatever she wants - maybe she’ll keep it and maybe she won’t.

My daughter (6) was batman for Halloween this year but she also loves princesses and she still insists I call her “Princess Batman” and so I do lol

My daughter (3) has introduced herself by her nickname (Bean) before. I’ve had some side eyes but never anyone throw an adult tantrum over it. Usually, I just nip it and tell them it’s her nickname and that’s what they can call her, but her real name is ____ . Then everything is fine. 

It’s a name. Your SIL sounds like she has a control issue. If it was me, I’d tell her she could kick rocks and keep her attitude and opinions to herself.",2023-11-27 01:58:53,False
privacy,young people and social media ban,Why being a more private person is considered not normal these days?,"I had snarky remarks by my family members for not wanting to just give out my phone numbers/ emails to corporations, if I'm not wanting to be on camera/ videos (laypersons will also comment this), and other privacy reasons. This became the ""norm"" after all these touch phone/ social media etc happen. If I refuse, I would be seen as paranoid, getting snarky comments like are you a criminal etc. It's like people think they have a right to everyone being open and sharing everything

I think I am more private in general, because I dont want my abusive family to track me down. I had doctors released my information without consent (also when I was above 21 btw), that I dont feel safe in general. I had other organizations cc-ed my email to my parents when my parents called to ask about my status. In general, I also know email can be very easily shared. The potential for anything to be hacked and leaked is not 0 either with all the news of organizations being hacked",302,62,hellohelp23,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1fw9ez2/why_being_a_more_private_person_is_considered_not/,2024-10-04 20:48:14,"A lot of people assume if you’re being private that means “you have something to hide”.

When in reality most of us are just sick of our info getting stolen/sold to scammers.

I guarantee those same people who assume privacy is weird will think  differently after they get scammed or their identity stolen.
---
Because people got convinced that privacy is not normal. This is done by design, especially by governments and government actors in order to know everything about us and police us as soon as we disagree.  
just 50 years ago, governments didn't knew sh1t about citizens, especially outside big cities.
---
The argument  of ""Well, if you're not doing anything  wrong..."" is a specious one.   You have no idea what will be considered ""wrong"" in the next 10 or 20 years. but by then, they will have extracted  the information that prove our guilt.   The powers that be, hope that by turning up the heat gradually, we will simply and tacitly comply with their data mining maneuvers. 

Pushback where you can.  Say No if possible and don't do business if it data mining seems to be part of the game.
---
I would like to live in a society where wanting to be private is normalized, to the point where people don't have to act like you're a pariah. Your explanations make sense, and you shouldn't have to give them to people to justify why you feel a certain way. Especially as long as you aren't hurting anybody else in the process, which it sounds like you're not.

I've never found an all-encompassing way to explain to anybody why privacy is good and important, nothing short and quippy. Usually you have to know the person you're talking to, what bothers them, etc, to formulate an explanation.

Depending on the political leanings of the person, you *could* say something like ""Do you really trust that data in the hands of... (Liberals like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos, conservatives like Peter Thiel and Larry Ellison)"" and that might be a shortcut.

Parenting,age verification social media Australia,11 year old boy. Not sure what went wrong.,"I don’t know what’s going on with my once sweet and kind firstborn.
He used to be kind, mostly well-behaved, and very loving.
He was moody, very strong-willed, and a bit hyper, but overall an amazing kid.

He just turned 11, and over the past year, he’s changed so much that I can’t understand what’s happening.

He’s rejecting any guidance from us, mostly from me. It’s almost as if he’s intentionally pushing me away and wants me to know he doesn’t want anything from me. It’s not all the time, but at least 90% of the time.

He wants to do whatever he wants. He shows zero respect for me, and while he seems to be afraid of my husband just because he’s male, he’s still challenging him in ways I never imagined possible. He literally doesn’t listen to us.

He’s acting very selfishly, and I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. Living with him feels like a constant challenge. I didn’t think this would happen so early. I know the teenage years can be rough, but he’s not even a teenager yet. He wants to act so much more mature than his age, and I don’t understand it.

He’s doing well in school (for now) but I’m worried that could change. He went from being very motivated to succeed in school to not caring at all… unless we take away video games. That’s the only thing that seems to matter to him anymore.

He’s also very interested in talking to girls. He’s only 11! It just feels too early. My husband says it’s normal, but I’m seeing patterns that really worry me. I never thought he would act like this.

At one point, I blamed myself. I wondered if I did something wrong while he was growing up. But honestly, if I stick to the facts, he had the most beautiful, supportive childhood, surrounded by people who loved him deeply.

Is this common? Will it pass? How do moms/dads deal with this kind of heartbreak and worry?

Edit: to add thank you so much for the support. His changes added to my premenopausal symptoms and usual anxiety were wreaking havoc in my head. I felt so supported by this community of fellow parents. I’m taking all feedback in. 

He is intimidated of my husband or afraid, because when my husband who is a big 6’1 man, with a voice that is very strong he “fears” him but we don’t think he respects him either so it’s temporary. 

Also to add in a comment I said he stood up to my husband I meant to say he kinda wanted to “square up” to him if that makes sense. ESL here fully fluent in English but there are still certain words that I don’t use often and get them wrong lol. 


Edit2: he doesn’t have social media. He has a phone but can’t download any apps w/on my approval. He can’t even search online. No YouTube on the phone. He only has one hour limit a day of use on the phone. It shuts down after one hour of use. My husband and I have his access code. But I will check his laptop. We forgot about that. 

He only plays games one hour a week and if he’s behaved well he can play more here and there however I can see where we can structure this reward of random play more tied to a reward or take it all together as games are so addictive. 
TV and YouTube we told him he can’t watch it but here’s where his lack of interest in what we say is: he watches it anyway. But I guess is better he does it when we are there than hiding?! 

His grades are good A’s and one B. He’s in a gifted program. Plays piano and saxophone. 

He’s a great kid. But why I was so concerned is that the change is of 180. I do talk to teachers and that’s how I know he’s rebelling a bit in class too. He went from being the perfect student to just wanting to be popular with the class and funny etc. The one liked by everyone. Worrisome too as what that leads to… seeking external validation only. 

Anyways. I probably sound like I was exaggerating but it doesn’t feel like it. I know I need to make a lot changes with myself and the adults in the house be on the same page on everything! He’s very smart and i think he sees any crack and will use it to rebel and seems from the comments he’s doing it in a very expected way. I’m grieving the “perfect little boy” but I need to welcome the man he’s becoming and keeping loving him and guiding him from a bit further away than before. I do have a therapist who has helped me in the past when this issue started and I will seek her out again to calm down and take a chill pill. She did say back then: Well the sign that you did a good job is that he’s overall one of the most well adjusted kids in school. Wise words. But I need to work on back up a bit.

If he is doing well in school it may help just to back off a little and let him find himself. Obviously with the exception of putting himself in danger. Natural consequences are often a strong motivator. You could always check in with his teacher and see how he is acting at school. I’m guessing you get the brunt of the angst because he feels safe at home.

This is called puberty.   Roll with it and have a sense of humor.  Give him freedoms as much as you can.   If you try to clamp down and force him into a box it will make it all worse and damage your relationship with him, including encouraging him to hide stuff from you.

Sounds like puberty to me.

A few things that have made my life easier with my preteen and teen is learning what kind of communication makes them feel respected, and making agreements based on that.   
  
I didn't realize that just speaking to them like I was used to (you know, the straightforward Mom instructions for everything) was now making them feel like I didn't respect them or care about how they felt about things. 

There's very little reason not to apply the same respect we would give an older person. Like instead of, ""Go clean your room"" and expecting it to be immediate, we'd say, ""Sometime today/when you're done with XYZ, would you please tidy up your room?"" And in exchange they communicate with me, either yes, or ""I just need \_\_\_ amount of time first and then I will.""  
  
Or, agreeing that I'd stop telling them to do so much and in exchange they'll keep on top of things on their own, because they know pretty well what needs to happen.  

And, trusting their judgment more and *telling* them that's what you're doing, just in general. Wanting to try new things, wanting to do something on their own, etc. And adding in, ""I trust you'll listen to your gut on whether it's right for you and you'll stop or ask for help if it isn't.""

The flip side is that they agree that if they haven't followed *their* side of the arrangement, that when you remind them, they'll be respectful in their response and will get it done asap. 

The less you give them to push against (*not* including boundaries, which are necessary) the easier it is to get along and still get things accomplished.

Parenting,social media age restriction Australia,Feeling sorry for this generation of kids,"I really feel for kids growing up today. It seems like smartphones have really stolen their freedom, their childhood, and all those amazing physical activities we used to take for granted. For some reason, parents are handing over phones younger and younger, and once that happens, there's no turning back. Peer pressure and curiosity quickly lead them down the social media rabbit hole, and it's a deep, dark place many never escape. It's just so sad that this generation might never truly experience the carefree happiness and freedom that childhood should be all about.

Edit: Just to clarify a couple of things - I did not mean we grew up in a golden age back then, and it was all perfect. Just very different. Sure, kids back then could sit in front of the TV all day. But that was about it. They did not have personal devices with the possibility for unsupervised access to just about anything. I am also not suggesting we keep them in the dark about modern-day tech and suddenly throw them into the world at 18. They can absolutely use computers, learn stuff, etc. All of this can be perfectly done without them having their own smartphones and social media accounts until they are mature enough to handle them responsibly. I refuse to accept that age is 6 or 7 years.",296,156,proxima-centauri-,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1ktmqii/feeling_sorry_for_this_generation_of_kids/,2025-05-23 15:41:08,"Welcome to r/Parenting!

Its a battle we have to actively decide to fight. It cant just happen to us as parents. We have to be “those parents” when it comes to giving them phones. I get eye rolls sometimes when I say my kids will not have a phone until theyre at least 16. Its going to be hard, but a hill Im going to die on. For anyone that thinks Im being dramatic, read or listen to the Anxious Generation. It gives stats & numbers on the reason you should not give them a phone.

Maybe it’s just where I live, but I see plenty of kids playing outside without phones. They come over to my house and play with my kid till dark. We also have her in different activities and do a lot of outdoor stuff with her. That said, I got my daughter a “dumb phone” and don’t regret it at all. She can connect with her friends, call me when she’s out and doesn’t get additional screen time from it.

This is such an easy solve. Just don’t give them a smartphone or tablet. My kids have had the same childhood that I had, and that was because we made it that way by choice.

Just yesterday, my kid was showing me how he can jump down a 2ft high obstacle in the sidewalk, and I remembered some crazy thing I used to do as a child. Like climbing over a 6ft brick wall, crossing a neighbors yard and climbing another 12ft wall (with the help of a tree) so I could go swimming on a pool in a nearby school.

Today, I would never let my kids do that, but those were some formative experiences for me, and they will never have anything similar.",2025-05-23 15:41:08,False
Parenting,kids off social media,My wife has successfully accomplished no screen time.... And I hate it.,"have a 3 year old (E) and a 5 month old (M) and my wife stays at home with them and is just an amazing mom. And amazing is really an understatement... Like, just as a point of reference, we sent E to 3K for socialization but my wife doesn't think she benefits from being there all day. So, after killing herself to get both kids out the door and drop off at 8, she basically turns right around and does pick up at 12. 

My wife has managed to actually pull off the no/limited screen time recommendations. Until age two, E saw not one second of screens and for the past year sees maybe a total of 15 minutes of screens in any given week. It's clearly great for E, but.... I fucking hate it...

I don't get to participate in any kids media! I've watched maybe 5 episodes of sesame street and a handful of 3 minute youtube videos from Highlights Kids. I've never seen Bluey, no Peppa pig, no Ms. Rachel. And to be clear, I don't want to leave the kids in front of the TV while I do other things. I just want to watch Toy Story with them.. I haven't had a chance to get annoyed by my kids insistence on watching Frozen 10,000 times. I love video games and was looking forwards to that being part of my relationships with my kids, but I've never shown E Mario because my wife wouldn't approve. 

I've tried talking to my wife about this, but I feel weird arguing that we should be doing a worse job raising the kids. Whenever I've tried in the past my wife just says this is what's best for them, but ""Fine just do what you want."" Then whenever I do try I can feel her eyes boring into the back of my head or her ""surprise"" that I leave a show on for more than 5 minutes at a time. It's even weirder because E doesn't ask to watch movies or TV. How could she since she literally doesn't know they exist? So it feels a lot like I'm trying to introduce smoking into my child's life just because I smoke and was looking forwards to doing it with her. 

I feel like I have no room to even slowly introduce things... I get home from work at 5 and E goes to bed at 7. In that time E eats dinner and usually has a bath and I give M a daily bottle. I usually have maybe 15 minutes of 1:1 playing with E on a given night. I don't want her to choose TV over Legos... but I kinda do at least sometimes... And my wife doesn't approve of that anyway because it's blue light too close to bed time which might interfere with their sleep. On the weekends my wife has found all these great activities that E and M both love and get so much out of, and then the rest of the day they want to read books and paint and build forts. I love doing all of that but.... Well...

I guess I just need a sanity check. I sometimes feel like our whole culture has become fixated on decreasing media time as much as possible but I love media and feel like and generally positive part of my life. Sure there are dangers associated with it, but don't we like it for a reason?

I recently had the chance to talk to a researcher who told me it's the parent's job to model healthy media habits to their children. Screen time isn't bad per se, being left alone in front of the TV is the problem. Watching a movie together is not only fine, but actually a good way to model responsible media consumption.
---
I'm pretty sure I get what you're trying to say.  It's what's best for sure,  but watching those kids' shows is inarguably part of the norm.  It was the norm for most of us growing up.  It's also weirdly exciting when your kid loves a movie or show that you did-- like a shared experience. 

3 is too little to appreciate it still,  though.  They won't generally  sit still and watch for that long even if you tried.  You'll have to be patient a little longer.

We had very little screen time for our kids until our son was going into kindergarten and then we realized we wanted him to have some kid-version pop culture knowledge and stuff to bond with other kids over - superheroes or Lego shows or whatever he and his buddies might be interested in.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has again backed down from its decades-old threats to start requiring all airline passengers to show ID that the TSA deems to be compliant with the [REAL-ID Act of 2004.](https://papersplease.org/wp/category/real-id/) But the new rules proposed by the TSA would create new problems that won’t go away until Congress repeals the REAL-ID Act.

In a [notice published in the Federal Register on September 12th](https://www.regulations.gov/document/TSA-2023-0003-0001) , the TSA has proposed another two-year postponement of the [most recent  of the “deadlines” the agency has imposed on itself](https://papersplease.org/wp/2022/12/05/dhs-resets-the-clock-on-its-threat-to-stop-flyers-without-id/) for REAL-ID enforcement.  But that postponement would be combined  with [interim rules for the next two years](https://www.regulations.gov/document/TSA-2023-0003-0001) that ignore the law and invite arbitrariness in how travelers are treated.

The TSA notes that “frustrated travelers at the checkpoint may also increase security risks” if the TSA stopped allowing travelers to fly without REAL-ID. But the TSA doesn’t mention its current [procedures for flying without any ID](https://papersplease.org/wp/2021/04/08/tsa-posts-video-showing-how-you-can-fly-without-id/) or its[ position in litigation](https://papersplease.org/wp/2023/06/12/tsa-misstates-the-case-law-on-id-to-fly/) that no law or regulation requires airline passengers to show *any* ID. Instead, The TSA claims without explanation that without this postponment, “individuals without  REAL ID-compliant DL/ID or acceptable alternative would be unable to board federally regulated aircraft.”

[Comments from the public](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/TSA-2023-0003/document) on the proposed rule are due by October 15, 2024. [Dozens of comments](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/TSA-2023-0003/comments) have already been submitted, almost all of them opposing requiring REAL-ID to fly.

We’ll be submitting comments opposing the proposed rules and reminding the TSA that (1) [no state is yet in compliance with the REAL-ID Act](https://papersplease.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IDP-mDL-comments-16OCT2023.pdf), which would require sharing of driver and ID databases with *all* other states, and (2) [neither the REAL-ID Act nor any other Federal law requires air travelers to have, to carry, or to show any ID](https://papersplease.org/wp/2024/05/22/new-dhs-publicity-about-real-id/).

Unless the law is changed to try to impose an unconstitutional ID requirement as a condition on the right to travel by common carrier, the TSA must [continue to recognize the right to fly without ID](https://papersplease.org/wp/2017/04/13/yes-you-can-fly-without-id/). Any distinction by the TSA or other Federal agencies between state-issued ID, when no state complies with the REAL-ID Act or could do so until all states participate in the [national REAL-ID database](https://papersplease.org/wp/2016/02/11/how-the-real-id-act-is-creating-a-national-id-database/) (SPEXS), would be arbitrary and unlawful.

The TSA is [proposing](https://www.regulations.gov/document/TSA-2023-0003-0001) what it describes as phased enforcement of the prohibition on acceptance by Federal agencies (in circumstances, which don’t include travel by common carrier, in which the law requires individuals to show ID) of ID that doesn’t comply with the REAL-ID Act.

Under the rules proposed by the TSA, full enforcement of the REAL-ID Act would be postponed by another two years, from the previous arbitrary deadline of May 7, 2025, to a new and equally arbitrary deadline (subject to further postponments) of May 5, 2027.

In the interim, the rules proposed by the TSA would authorize the TSA itself and all other Federal agencies to engage in graduated enforcement measures against individuals who don’t have ID the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) deems to be compliant with the REAL-ID Act

The TSA suggests that graduated enforcement measures might include the creation of new databases tracking the use of “noncompliant” ID, on the basis of which agencies would limit the number of times an individual could enter a Federal building or engage in other activities without  showing “compliant” ID. But the TSA woud leave it to agencies’ discretion to decide what conditions to impose on use of noncompliant ID.

These graduated enforcement policies would determine who is, and who is not, able to exercise Federally-protected rights. Contrary to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), those policies would not be specified in regulations published in the Federal Register. They would be adopted by [individual agencies](https://papersplease.org/wp/2020/11/10/what-does-real-id-act-enforcement-really-mean/) without prior notice or comment.

Even if the REAL-ID Act had authorized the TSA to delegate to other Federal departments authority to issue agency-specific REAL-ID enforcement rules, which it didn’t, those regulations would be subject to the APA. The TSA [asked Congress to exempt REAL-ID Act implementation](https://papersplease.org/wp/2020/07/28/senate-bill-would-exempt-real-id-from-due-process-and-oversight/) from the APA and the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), but Congress [declined to enact those exemptions](https://papersplease.org/wp/2021/01/03/real-id-act-amended-but-dhs-doesnt-get-the-exemptions-it-wanted/).

In its latest [Notice of Proposed Rulememaking](https://www.regulations.gov/document/TSA-2023-0003-0001) (NPRM), the TSA acknowledges that the PRA and the Privacy Act  would require agencies to publish Federal Register notices and obtain approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for new databases and collection of information about users of noncompliant ID. But the  TSA doesn’t mention the APA. It acts as though Congress approved the APA exemption it rejected for REAL-ID rules.

The TSA’s latest notice doesn’t mention the agency’s [most recent previous proposal](https://papersplease.org/wp/2023/10/16/the-tsa-wants-to-put-a-government-tracking-app-on-your-smartphone/) related to REAL-ID, which would have authorized the use of smartphone traveler-tracking apps as an alternative to REAL-ID drivers license or ID cards. That proposal hasn’t been finalized, but [additional background information](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/TSA-2023-0002/document?sortBy=postedDate) was disclosed last month, perhaps indicating preparations by the TSA for a new round of comments on that proposed rule.",280,64,ColdInMinnesooota,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1fltrwo/tsa_again_backs_down_from_its_realid_threats_again/,2024-09-21 03:15:37,"lol, I was just at the DMV and joked with the agent there about whether or not the REAL-ID requirement would be pushed back again

They're completely closed-source, they have a very vague privacy policy, they're destroying private Reddit clients, and they censor **EVERYTHING.**

But, if we should be doing anything in this subreddit, I would think it's sharing & promoting a better place to talk about this stuff. Anything else would basically nullify the entire point of having a community of people who care about privacy.

It shouldn't be Reddit. Maybe start with Lemmy - it's a lot like reddit in a lot of ways, just with way less people. But, it's completely open source, and it only takes the information you let it.

Counterpoint: it's a *great* idea to talk about privacy *everywhere*.
---
The problem is that talking about privacy is a self-serving goal.  We all know how to be perfectly private, or at least as close to perfectly private as a person *can* be.  Stay off of social media, avoid the internet as much as possible, use a dumb phone instead of a smart phone (or just no cellphone at all), and buy things with cash whenever possible.  Essentially, live like an Amish person.  So if the goal is for us as individuals to be more private, we already *know* what to do.  It's just a matter of whether it's worth losing the convenience that we're accustomed to.  And if someone else *doesn't* know how to be private, why should *I* care?  *I'm* private.  *Your* privacy is *your* problem.  So there's no point in talking about it for ourselves.  
  
The thing is, I actually *do* care about your privacy.  I care about everyone's privacy.  I also don't know everything about being private while still using the internet.  I want to learn more, and I want to share what I know.  I want to help spread knowledge and techniques to improve privacy, and I want to help raise awareness of how our privacy is being violated, and why it's a problem (because some people don't care, because they're just unaware).  
  
To do this, we need to be able to reach lots of people.  To reach lots of people, we need popular platforms.  What good is Lemmy for talking about privacy?  If you're using Lemmy, you already *know* about privacy.  Not only that, but nobody uses it.  How are we going to reach people using a platform that has nobody on it?  That's kinda like using Dreddit to spread the word about the deep web.  Everyone there is already on board anyway.",2023-12-07 14:11:20,False
Parenting,young people and social media ban,Beware of this inappropriate YouTube channel targeted to kids-sexual & exploitation style ,"How are some of the videos from Rebecca Zamolo targeted for children still up while having many inappropriate acts for young children? 

Why doesn’t YouTube ban the people who use children for attention and use inappropriate acts for videos targeted towards children

She has one of the most followed kids YouTube channels that’s supposed to be for kids. I saw my daughter watching her videos and some of the videos negatively caught my attention.  I’m in the film industry but we never approach videos for kids like this. 

In one of the videos the participants have to either take of a clothing (strip) or kiss each other with weird stuff like hot sauce. Some guys take off their shirts and some guys and girls kiss weirdly with prolonged slow motion zoom in focus on the kissing with weird stuff in their mouths. 

In another older video I saw on Reddit they rated how scandalous each person’s outfit is. 

She also uses her newborn child on many videos as the main focus for thumbnails and videos. 

As a mother I thought these types of videos were inappropriate for young children. Has it become normal in 2024 or is there something up behind the scene?

Most kids watch her videos and parents are not aware of what happens in these videos. She gets millions of views and YouTube is fine with it too. 

It’s up to us parents to save our children. 

This YouTube channel is pretty much child exploitation and sexual references and brainwashing targeted to kids.

In Korea where I lived for a while they have this kind of system for a lot of their online activity. It's highly integrated into a lot of their native internet platforms but even the localized versions of google and youtube and the like are forced to comply with regulations.

In some contexts it's not that hard to get around, like with google you can just visit the ncr version and search whatever you like without age verification, but other things like youtube will always redirect to the Korean site if you aren't running a VPN; for instance someone might randomly share a video of the latest T-Swift MV and when you open the link it's telling you to verify your age even though there's nothing apparent in the clip why it would be adult-rated. So that kind of censorship can be disruptive sometimes.

Of course the requirement of an ID number and a mobile phone number linked to that also poses a problem for temporary visitors. Since I am no longer a resident in Korea I had to return the former and cancel the latter which means I can no longer do online banking with my Korean accounts and when I visit there I can be locked out of services like food delivery and online shopping because I can't verify my identity. I understand some of these brands do have some tourist-oriented interfaces to get around this issue, but it's limited and the non-Korean versions of websites and apps tend to be poorly maintained and very buggy. 

Then of course there is Naver cafes, the subreddits of Korea. But thanks to the ID system, you can screen out people you don't wish to be able to access certain communities, for instance a specific gender, which leads to problems like the recently-emerging group of stay-at-home dads not being able to register to the most popular parenting discussion boards because only females can join. So this can encourage echo chambers. What's more requiring ID verification means your identity and activity is not truly anonymous.

I do think social media is problematic for the youth but this kind of approach is not the answer.

Parenting,young people and social media ban,AITA for asking another mom to keep pictures she took of our kids playing private?,"Sanity check please. 

I was with my 3 year old at the park today and he met and started playing with another boy there. 

The other kid’s mom expressed how cute it was they were playing together and immediately pulled her phone out and started taking pictures and videos of them. 

Now I will admit I probably spend far too much time on social media reading horrible things about child exploitation in the internet. I’m very careful not to have any pictures of him on social media just because I’m a private person in general. 

I’m a people pleaser so it was really awkward of me to say anything, but I felt a bit uncomfortable so eventually mustered up the courage. I very politely mentioned that I don’t put any pictures of him online so if it was okay to not post it on social media. I genuinely did say it like that and wasn’t confrontational at all. 

Well this mom got VERY offended and angry at me. She told me “of course I wouldn’t put it on social media” and was visibly very annoyed. She then spoke to her son in their native language and he promptly turned to my son, said “no”, made “go away” gestures and stopped playing with him. This was upsetting for my son. 

I feel pretty awful and think maybe I over reacted, but you just don’t know with how comfortably everyone seems to put strangers on social media. I feel sad I interrupted my son’s playtime and anxious at whether I did the wrong thing. I really think I would have asked before taking a picture of somebody else’s kid. I’ve never done it.

My daughter was playing at the park with a little boy she just met and the parent said to me, ""This is the first time he's really played independently. I'm going to take some pictures of him but I'll keep your child out of the frame. Is that okay?"" I said ""Of course!"" The thought had never crossed my mind to check in with other parents like that. It was such a simple, polite thing and now I do the same at parks when I'm taking pictures of my own child.

The normal reaction to what you asked is “oh no of course I wouldn’t do that” and then continue the conversation as per usual.

I think she had other things going on that day.
---
She probably just got embarrassed. I don't think you were necessarily wrong for saying something. But not everyone takes photos for social media. She may have just wanted to show the dad or grandma because it was cute and felt like she was doing something wrong when you made the comment about social media. Or she was genuinely offended that you'd even think she'd post your kid without permission. Who knows.

While I think it would have been nice for her to ask about photographing the kids playing together first, there's nothing inherently wrong with her doing so.


 Likewise, I think your request to keep the photos off of social media was valid.


 You said that they have a native tongue? I'm wondering if perhaps something didn't get lost in translation, literally. If you just requested that she not post the pictures, maybe she took it as not sharing them with her family? Perhaps after you made it known that you were uncomfortable, she felt like she couldn't share the photos in general. Perhaps she felt awkward about taking more photos with your kid in them and felt it easier to keep her kid from interacting with yours if she wanted to continue taking pictures of her kid.


 I do find her reaction odd, so sorry it happened. But at the end of the day, you made it clear that you were uncomfortable with pictures and her honoring your request was ending the play between kids.",2024-03-29 09:17:23,False

AustralianPolitics,Australia under 16 social media ban,Scott Morrison is getting Australia’s highest honour despite a laundry list of scandals and embarrassments,"Media have been circulated a list of every Australian set to get a King’s Birthday honour. Scott Morrison — whose legacy includes robodebt, multiple ministries and habitual lying — is the latest politician to be given the award.

Cam Wilson

Scott Morrison will be given Australia’s highest award for service as part of the King’s Birthday honours, the latest in a line of powerful Australians who have received the honour simply for doing their job.

The former prime minister is one of 830 Australians included on the as-yet-unpublished King’s Birthday honours list that will be made public on Sunday night.

Morrison will receive the Companion of the Order of Australia for “eminent service to the people and Parliament of Australia, particularly as prime minister, to notable contributions to global engagement, to leadership of the national COVID-19 response, to economic initiatives, and to national security enhancements, especially through leadership of Australia’s contribution to AUKUS”.

Each year, an embargoed list of the awardees is sent out by the Governor-General’s Office to the media ahead of time. 

Embargoes are a semi-formal agreement between journalists and PR professionals, and are commonplace in journalism. They involve a journalist or outlet agreeing to hold off publishing a certain story or fact until a future date, in return for information that allows them to prepare their coverage ahead of time (for example, lining up interviews with those awarded). It is a standard request of those who are sent the information, be it about the launch of a new Kmart product, an academic report about to be published, or indeed the honour’s list, but it is not an obligation unless you agree to it.

I did not receive the list, nor did I agree to any embargo. I was tipped off to the list, and have confirmed it with another person. Every newsroom in the country has this list.

During the writing process, I found out that someone at Crikey had in fact been sent the list but hadn’t opened the email. Bernard Keane’s not going to lose any sleep if you take him off the embargoed honours distribution list. 

We’ve chosen to report solely on Morrison’s honour now because we think it’s noteworthy that, yet again, one of an elite class of Australians is de facto granted honours — especially someone with as ignominious a record as his. On Sunday at 10pm when the embargo lifts? His honour will be swept up in a sea of hundreds of awardees.

Australia’s honours system is supposed to recognise the “outstanding service and contributions of Australians”. Anyone can nominate, and the awards are chosen by the 19-member Council for the Order of Australia.   

Over the past few years, this system has faced criticism for the over-representation of white, male, wealthy elites. Tony Abbott and Dan Andrews have also received the honour. Even within the awards, the higher the award, the less diverse it gets. 

By some accounts, the field of awardees has improved over time by expanding the pool of those who are being awarded. The press release for this year’s awards boasts that there are nearly 30% more awardees than on the Australia Day list.  

Just because more people are receiving the award doesn’t change the fact that the best way to guarantee one isn’t to be an average Australian who goes above and beyond in their service for their community and nation, but to be prime minister or have some other high-profile gig.

But should the process of receiving the country’s highest honours be a formality just because you were chosen by your partyroom, regardless of your actual accomplishments? 

It’s no secret that Crikey has been critical of Morrison as prime minister. We were among the first in the media to plainly call out his habitual deception in our Dossier of Lies and Falsehoods. He was the minister, then prime minister, who oversaw robodebt. When a royal commission found that he allowed the cabinet to be misled about the legal status of the scheme, Morrison claimed he was the real victim. He also presided over a wholly unnecessary death toll in nursing homes during COVID.

Morrison made a mockery of our system of government — and the office of the governor-general — by secretly appointing himself to multiple ministries. It’s still early days, but some predict that he will be remembered as among “the least-distinguished of Australian prime ministers”. 

If you think the man deserves to have something to show for his time in office, I have great news! Morrison almost immediately took multiple jobs at AUKUS-linked DYNE Maritime and corporate advisory firm American Global Strategies, sidestepping the 18-month post-ministerial lobbying ban by saying he was simply giving “strategic advice”. He’s doing just fine, and is enjoying the many post-prime ministerial perks that come after a stint in the Lodge.

If this system chooses to continue to demean the value of our awards by rubber-stamping every high-level politician, there’s nothing Crikey can do about that. But we see no reason to play along with the pomp and ceremony as if it’s truly about merit and service, not least because we never agreed to.

We hope this draws attention to the ridiculous convention of patting the backs of the most congratulated people. And most of all, we hope this means Morrison’s award is old news by the time the full list is released later this weekend, so the truly deserving will get their time to shine.",238,155,CommonwealthGrant,https://www.crikey.com.au/2025/06/06/scott-morrison-kings-birthday-honour-crikey/,2025-06-06 03:26:49,"**Greetings humans.**

Parenting,Albanese social media ban,Homeschooling trend ,"I’m sure everyone’s aware about the rise of homeschooling. I live in an area that it’s always been very popular. 
Traditionally, these families were more religious or had a child heavily involved in a travel sport. Now more than ever I hear people choosing to homeschool due to “missing them too much” when they are at school and not wanting them “exposed to riff raff”. 
Of course you hear about valid school shooting concerns but more often then not “indoctrination” concerns. 

I recently read a book called Education Wars, it was about public schools being these great equalizers. That parents don’t like when their kids develop opinions that challenge them or interact with non curated friends. How this idea of indoctrination is just used to scare
Parents. Having a child be addressed as a name they’d like is not indoctrination, it’s called being polite. Using correct terminology and learning about LGBTQ rights makes your more empathic not gay. That if we all banned together to solve these problems instead of pulling out our kids. We could enact real change. 

If you only pick who yours kids are around how can you trust them to pick for themselves when you’re not holding their hand? 

If the school day is too long away from them/too much time receiving instruction how will they handle the time commitments of adulthood? 

I am convinced it has a lot to do with our society and social media. Creating fear based parenting. I do understand that times have changed but some  of the new precautions feel irrational. (Anti vax/challenging phone rules at school to have constant access, crunchy diets to prevent cancer) EVERY post on IG is laced with comments about “knowing someone who (insert something tragic) from (vaccines/cancer/colored dye)” when in reality very little of these anecdotes are valid. We introduced life saving AED machines everyone long before Covid, heart defects are the most common birth defect. We have eradicated diseases with vaccines. Cancer mortality is the lowest it’s been.  Science is on our side. 

It’s this weird mix between fear and performance. Going so hard on all the things for our kids that it’s missing the part where kids develop their own sense of self and ideas. Everything catering to the kid and their needs vs preparing them for the actual world. Where you don’t always chose the time, who is there. Not everyone has a list of your preferences or cares.

One thing I find fascinating about the comments is that the reasons seem to go in all directions - it's because the schools are too liberal, too conservative, too academic, not academic enough, etc.  It seems like the common thread is really the rise of people believing education should be more bespoke to their own wants and needs rather than adjusted to a common denominator.  Which I'm not sure is necessarily good or bad.

If I could afford a different option for my children or if I was in a better position to homeschool, I absolutely would.  

My oldest was in kindergarten when Covid shut downs happened and didn’t really return to a regular classroom environment until third grade.  In both third and fourth grade, her classroom had 35 kids in it.  I don’t know how big her fifth grade class will be for another few weeks, but I do know it will be large.  My youngest will be entering first grade this year and I can tell their experiences are going to be completely different.  My oldest never really had the opportunity for learning handwriting.   She is ahead in all other areas but most of her peers aren’t even at their grade level academic wise.  She doesn’t have behavior issues or academic needs so she’s just…there.  

Her teachers do not like the push to use chrome books all the time, but they have no say.  The district keeps purchasing digital curriculums. Most of my daughter’s peers had their own smart phones last year as well. It causes so many issues and while they aren’t allowed in school, the drama and behavior comes into the school.  

I think people paint homeschooling with a pretty wide brush too.  There are a million different ways it can look curriculum wise.  Some are really simple and ready to go with the lessons all planned out, some require more work from the parent or adult to design their lesson plan how they’d like.  All of my nieces and nephews have been homeschooled and are now adults. They are so well adjusted and on their way to very successful lives. 

Watching my son’s kinder class last year when I was volunteering was also eye opening and frustrating.  Kids of that age aren’t made to be sitting still for 6 hours a day.  They do plenty of exercise breaks and recess and the teachers handle it well, but there are other issues.  They do a mock state testing with them and the questions are above a kinder comprehension level.  Some kids were so frustrated and down on themselves.  His teacher was so frustrated she’s required to do this.  

Unfortunately I can’t afford a private school and there aren’t many options for charters. We live in an area that funds the schools pretty well snd it’s still frustrating for us.  I do what I can outside of school but I’d love a different option.

I think you’re generalizing here. Possibly accusing these families of the same thing you’re doing. 

I say this as a public school teacher who will definitely send all her kids to public school. 

Public school is not what it used to be and while you’re assuming it’s about mixing with different cultures, traditions and the LGBTQ most parents home school because public schools are a mess. They are over crowded, underfunded and in some cases in the US, dangerous. 

We have no support systems for children with severe learning disabilities and little to no support for kids who are violent with both teachers and other students. 

So while I’m sure there are a few families that home school for religious reasons or whatever you think they’re concerned about. There’s a lot more who are just rightfully concerned with the state of our public schools, period.

I am a former public school teacher. My husband is a current public school teacher. We are both certified teachers. We both have master’s degrees. We homeschool our own children because we have a combined 33 years of experience in public schools and know we don’t want our children there. 

There is a huge trend of secular homeschoolers who homeschool because the public schools are too conservative Christian for their kids. I went to public school in the late 90s/early 00s and my high school physics teacher refused to teach the Big Bang. My biology teacher didn’t teach evolution. Here, books like The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank are banned in public school. Abstinence is the only sex education. The school board voted to “ban pronouns.” If you don’t live in a small town in a conservative area, it can be hard to understand that the public schools actually aren’t the best place for progressive, science minded, liberal individuals.",2024-08-22 20:32:27,False
Education,social media age restriction Australia,N.Y. set to become largest state in U.S. to enact school cellphone ban,"From our [article](https://www.silive.com/education/2025/05/ny-set-to-become-largest-state-in-us-to-enact-school-cellphone-ban.html?utm_source=redditsocial&utm_campaign=redditor) that went up today: 

Gov. Kathy Hochul announced on Tuesday that New York will become the largest state in the nation to require statewide, bell-to-bell restrictions on smartphones in K-12 schools.

“New York was the first state to target addictive social media feeds — and now we’re the largest state to restrict smartphones in schools throughout the entire school day,” Hochul said. “I know our young people succeed when they’re learning and growing, not clicking and scrolling — and that’s why New York continues to lead the nation on protecting our kids in the digital age.”

The cellphone ban is [part of an agreement and enactment of the state budget](https://www.silive.com/education/2025/04/ny-budget-includes-bell-to-bell-cell-phone-ban-in-schools.html), which included a $13.5 million investment to help schools implement the ban. The tentative budget agreement will go to the state legislature for a full vote.

The proposed cellphone ban in New York schools would be in place starting in the 2025-2026 school year and apply to all schools in public school districts. Charter schools and Boards of Cooperative Educational Services would also be under this requirement.

About the ban: Every student would be required to disconnect from their device during school hours bell-to-bell. This means there will be no unsanctioned use of smartphones and other internet-enabled devices on school grounds K-12 schools for the entire school day — including settings like classrooms, lunch, and study hall periods.

The policy proposed by the governor clarifies that students will be able to have access to simple cellphones without internet capability, as well as internet-enabled devices officially provided by their school for classroom instruction, like laptops or tablets used as part of lesson plans. Schools would also be required to give parents a way to contact their kids during the day when necessary.",230,139,statenislandadvance,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1kgc4r6/ny_set_to_become_largest_state_in_us_to_enact/,2025-05-06 18:39:05,"I’m interested to see how these bills will have any teeth in practice.

I think that's anecdotal for your experience. Facebook, Insta, TikTok, Twitter, etc. are still full of adverts (either actual adverts, or brand accounts, or influencers, or reposts) or politics/""news"", and are still where the greatest volume of people sit.

I am happy to see the likes of Tumblr, Discord, Pinterest, (Reddit?) etc. gain more traction. As it's much easier for a user to control what they see there, rather than a broad algorithm doing all the work.

So what I think we're seeing is a divide in usage, where people might be accessing both camps. And until the userbase on the first bunch dies down, you won't see any major changes there.

We live in a horrible world and social media is the pinnacle of it. Now with AI we will have less and less genuine information every year and a huge % of AI anomaly will be introduced into data. In the future we may have a hard time finding real data cause Google or OpenAI ain't doing shit to protect genuine data on the internet. Everyone abuses AI without reprecussion. Art is devalued and people are loving it. Where do I stop?

I’ve seen more posts that feel like digital scrapbooks—messy, funny, real. Less “influencer,” more “internet friend.” And the shift to platforms like Tumblr or Discord makes total sense. People are craving connection over curation.

Backup everything to the cloud, remember the password to access that cloud website, factory reset your phone.

Ideally, have some basic data on it, like pictures, memes, a handful of contacts, a random game, and a cat as a background photo.

Otherwise, if they ask about the reset, say you had intimate photos somewhere of you and your partner somewhere on it and didn't want to risk the government seeing them.

Comedy is skill, I think people forget that. Professional comedians dont just stand up and talk, they craft a show based upon a bunch of different skills and techniques. True there is an element of natural talents, but its like watching retired sports stars, they will always be skilled, but never as sharp as when they are training full time.

So for comedians, its the same. Once you move out of touring and into mainstream media, you lose the edge that stand up brings. You're not spending months craft a show because you have a filming / radio slots to fill every day/week. This coupled with becoming rich makes you lazy, and then add parenthood on top of that.

Then you have the ever shifting line of comedy, especially for observational comedy. What we find funny 10 years ago will not be funny in 10 years time because society changes, and the line you walk required for observational comedy changes.

AustralianPolitics,age verification social media Australia,Childcare is just the latest failure of Australia’s privatisation push. It’s time for an ideology overhaul | John Quiggin,"**Even the Productivity Commission is backing away from the for-profit model. We need to ensure that our human services serve humans**

**John Quiggin, Fri 16 May 2025 14.06 AEST**

A series of ABC 7.30 reports tells a familiar story of failure in human services. Inadequate staffing, dangerous incidents brushed under the carpet, ineffective regulation and, at the back of it all, for-profit businesses, either ASX-listed or financed by private equity.

This time it’s childcare but the same problems have emerged in vocational education, aged care, prisons, hospitals and many other services. Every time the answer we get is the same. More and better regulation, we are told, will make the market work better, allowing competition and consumer choice to work their magic.

The reason for this record of failure has been pointed out many times, and ignored just as often by policymakers. Businesses providing publicly funded or subsidised services can increase their profits in one of two ways. The hard way is to make technical or organisational innovations that provide a better service at lower cost. The easy way is to avoid meaningful improvements and approach rules with a “tick a box” attitude.

It would appear the easiest way of all, however, as claimed in the reports on childcare, is to cut corners on service quality, particularly in areas that are hard to check. Another favoured strategy is “cream-skimming” – providing services where the regulatory setup yields high margins while leaving the public or non-profit sector to deal with the intractable problems.

All of these strategies were employed on a huge scale to exploit VET Fee-Help, the vocational education and training scheme that represented the first big push towards for-profit provision of human services, beginning in 2009. Fee-Help was a disaster. Before it was scrapped in 2017 it swallowed [billions of dollars](https://www.smh.com.au/education/morrison-government-wipes-500-million-in-dodgy-debt-from-students-20191130-p53fnk.html) of public money. The scheme left students with worthless qualifications and massive debts, which were eventually wiped by the Morrison government in 2019.

The central statement of the ideology driving public policy in this area is the Productivity Commission’s 2016 report on competition in human services. The report presented market competition as the desired model for a wide range of human services, including social housing, services at public hospitals, specialist palliative care, public dental services, services in remote Indigenous communities and grant-based family and community services.

After being presented with ample evidence of the problems of for-profit provision, the PC responded with a single, evidence-free sentence: “The Commission considers that maximising community welfare from the provision of human services does not depend on adopting one type of model or favouring one type of service provider.”

Although the PC had previously hailed competition in VET as a model of well-regulated competition, the undeniable failure of Fee-Help was now blamed on the regulator, the Australian Skills Quality Authority. But the only solution offered was more and better “safeguards”, a term which usually means Band-Aid solutions to fundamental design problems.

Since then we have seen catastrophic failures in [aged care](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/nov/16/aged-care-residents-found-to-be-at-greater-risk-in-for-profit-homes-than-government-run-ones), the [reversal of the move to private prisons](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/dec/24/australian-authorities-once-embraced-privately-operated-prisons-but-some-governments-are-taking-back-control) and the [exclusion of acute care hospitals from so-called “public-private partnerships”](https://www.nsw.gov.au/ministerial-releases/nsw-to-ban-acute-hospitals-from-public-private-partnerships).

Even the PC is backing away from the for-profit model. Its latest report on childcare noted the growing dominance of the for-profit sector and observed that a much larger proportion of for-profit providers failed to meet standards. The chair of the inquiry, Prof Deborah Brennan, provided a supplementary statement urging action to reduce the share of for-profit businesses. Brennan observed that aspects of Australia’s “highly marketized approach” to childcare will “work against equitable, high quality provision unless moderated”.

“Accordingly, I suggest measures to strengthen and expand not for-profit provision, attention to the financial strategies of large investor-backed and private equity companies, and regulatory strategies to discourage providers whose business models and labour practices do not align well with the National Cabinet vision,” she wrote.

This expert judgment was a bridge too far for the PC ideologues, who ducked the issue for the most part. An exception was the idea of a tendering scheme for “persistent ‘thin’ markets”, where the commission proposed to “strongly prefer not-for-profit providers where a service is completely or substantially directly funded by government”*.* It was unclear why this preference did not extend to the much larger part of the sector that relies on indirect government funding through subsidies to parents.

To its credit, the Albanese government has done a good deal to repair the damage done to the public Tafe system, with increased funding and fee-free places. For-profit providers are complaining about the “[complete annihilation](https://caqa.com.au/blogs/news/complete-annihilation-of-the-private-vet-sector-how-labors-policies-are-targeting-private-rtos)” of the private sector, even as [yet more dodgy practices](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/nsw/this-is-out-of-control-the-750-tradies-who-bought-fake-qualifications-from-criminals-20250404-p5lp4o.html) are revealed.

But we need more than a sector-by-sector response. Rather than repeating the cycle of for-profit booms, failures, exposés and re-regulation, it’s time to admit that that the ideology of market competition has failed. For-profit corporations have no place, or at most a peripheral place, in the provision of basic human services, including health, education and childcare. “People before profit” might seem like a simplistic slogan but it is much closer to the truth than “competition and choice”.

I've said it a million times competition and capitalism is *great* in sectors where people aren't *required* to use a service. 

It's one thing to say ""let the market decide"" when it comes down to something like the corner store or clothing store you shop at, but when it comes to things like medicine, education, and now child care where people simply *have* to have a thing, that's where the state should step in and keep things fair.

People assume states exist naturally, they don't, they are constructs that exists to serve a purpose, and we've allowed ours to be perverted away from it's useful purpose.

Yeah, we need to stop subsidising private businesses. The only people benefiting from it are the business owners ripping us off from every angle.

Nationalise the childcare centres. We are already subsidising the fuck out of them anyway.

AskAnAustralian,young people and social media ban,"Young Aussies, do you feel lonely?","So I was at a grand final gathering over the weekend. Was speaking to some other relatives about socializing in today's day and age, etc. I basically expressed that I felt somewhat lonely and disconnected and that people my age don't really go out much.

A boomer relative basically told me that as a young guy I should be going out every night possible, even if I can't get friends to come round, just go out on my own even. I basically told aforementioned boomer relative between paying 650/pwk in rent, bills, groceries, I don't have the money nor time to be going out every night to the bar or pub and paying $14 a pint. Not even count the negative health effects. Personally, I feel like I'm in a good financial position for someone my age, I can afford my rent/bills/etc without going hungry, have enough to put away for savings, etc. However, without receiving some external support I don't know how some people could afford to go out more than once a month.

It sounds kind of crazy but more recently with summer and better weather coming up, I've been taking my soccer ball to the local park and have tried setting up just impromptu soccer games just with randoms and has actually had really positive feedback.

To a certain extent. I've more or less had the same couple of friends since high school, but over the past few years, they've just been doing it less and less for me. These days I don't know whether I hang out with them because I somewhat enjoy their company, or because I just don't really have another group of friends to move onto. 

I've started doing a few social sports to meet people, but I'm fairly reserved and it takes a bloody long time for me to be able to tell whether I like them or not...

I don't feel lonely, but I think my habits aren't the norm. I attend a local women's shed and as a rare millennial of the group, hang out with Gen X and Boomer ladies. We make things together and bring in snacks we baked at home. I love the idle chat, which often has depth despite the relaxed atmosphere. 

I have a huge group of zoomer/millenial friends on Discord where we game together and hang out. I then have the usual other friendships of people I've known forever.  It's quite a community rather than a gaming server, as we're insular and let people in based on values and hobbies rather than anyone who played a particular game.

I swap cooked meals and extra veg and fruit with our neighbour too. We always stop and chat, and I have a few other people I stop to chat with during dog walks. 

I do all this stuff because I did used to feel very isolated. I can't afford to go out and pay to socialise, that's for sure. I'm pretty extroverted so I love seeking people out and befriending them. I feel like it takes quite a bit of effort to do these days as we're all so busy and struggling to afford to exist.

Parenting,social media age restriction Australia,Devices are Destroying my Kids and my Marriage - HELP,"TL;DR to start:  Wife and I are not on the same page regarding media usage and it's cutting into our marriage.  I feel like my three kids (11, 9, 6) are suffering, and I feel unheard, not listened to, and increasingly prone to extreme measures regarding their devices. We need help from the community.
 
--
 
r/Parenting, I'm really struggling here.  These devices are killing me, but I cannot get on the same page with my wife regarding our approach going forward.
 
Some background.  I'm a Xennial who grew up in essentially an electronics free environment for most of my childhood.  We did not have TV.  We had a Nintendo, but it was heavily restricted.  Mostly what I played with were Legos, crap lying around, etc. Later (8th grade) I picked up on PCs and eventually earned a CS degree.  I'm not a tech luddite by any means and have used technology to great effect in my career.  I do not want to hinder my kids in this sense.
 
We're also both gamers and active users of our PCs (though I've really dropped off in the last year or so).  There are occasions where I will have spent several hours on my PC working on some long-term game, but that might be once every two weeks.  I'm also an adult, and I have other hobbies and activities.
 
We've also been together for 25 years, so it isn't like we don't know how to communicate effectively.  All the more frustrating here as we aren't communicating effectively.
 
We have three children with a complicating twist - our oldest is autistic with a severe cognitive disability.  Because of his issues, he has essentially grown up with media at all times.  He cannot do anything without having his media or iPad anymore.  It's mostly stuff like Roblox, Minecraft, and watching YouTube videos of these things.  His younger siblings see this.
 
So to the issue:  My wife - SAHM who works part time with her family's business - allows all our kids essentially unrestricted time on their iPads.  They mostly play on the Roblox platform, with some Minecraft mixed in.  Their use of these devices have practically become ritualistic, to the point where my wife claims that any change in ""their routine"" ruins her morning/evening and prevents her from getting them to school.  However, they will use these devices the minute they get up and it causes all sorts of getting ready for school issues as you can imagine.  In other words, they literally lose sleep to get up early to use these things before school.
 
When the kids come home, it's the same thing - iPad from the minute they get home until the minute they go to bed.  No outside, no exercise.  My wife says the kids ""need it to blow off steam from school.""  However, my middle son - a perfectly capable human being - is now basically an ""indoor kid.""  He won't go outside.  He's gaining weight (has a muffin top at age 9), and we aren't a fat family genetically.  Whenever I talk about my son sitting there all day with his iPad grinding away on Bloxfruits and eating snacks, she tells me not to shame him and that he's just having fun like any other kid.
 
And of course, in the end I have nothing in common with these Roblox games. My son comes to me and talks about all his grinding, all this stuff he's gotten on Skibidi Toilet Tower Defense, all his little bloxfruits and my eyes just glaze over.  I try to explain that there's never an end to these freemium games, and no matter what he achieves there will never be an end or a specific achievement, but I don't want to be too discouraging to his feelings.
 
I'm at my wits end.  I'm failing as a parent.  I know what I need to do, but it isn't my willpower that's in the way - it's my wife.  At times she'll recognize the issue, but she has no willpower to deal with the whining and screaming that accompany the loss of any devices.  I can't even get her to agree to have the kids do chores before using devices.  When I take the devices away, I'm a bad guy and ""I'm ruining her day while I'm off working and not having to deal with it.""",194,186,SenatorAdamSpliff,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1kmkzar/devices_are_destroying_my_kids_and_my_marriage/,2025-05-14 17:23:19,"Welcome to r/Parenting!

1. Agree on new rules with your wife.

2. Tell the kids well in advance that the rules are going to change.  Explain the rules, and the reasons for the change.  Set expectations for how much screen time they will have when the rules are in effect.

3. Identify replacement activities for the new screen-free time.  Have your kids participate in this if it makes sense.  Get their buy in.

4. Take a week or two off from work when the new rules go into effect.  Teach your kids how to leverage the replacement activities.  Be right there with them.  Help absorb the transition hell on behalf of your wife.

——————

Last year, our kids were watching too much tv, so we decided to kill screen based entertainment on weeknight.

We warned them a few weeks ahead of time.  We timed the effective date with the end of the school year because we did not want them to “blame” school.

They still watch too much tv on the weekends but it is much improved.  Sometimes they drive us crazy but that is kind of their job.  I have to resist the urge to turn on the tv, but I manage.
---
Personally I think you need to start using the weekends to get your kids outside - even if they complain. Go camping, go swimming, go hiking with no service available, go to a park. They will complain - but start small at first 30 min then 1 hour. I bet before you know it they’ll be happy playing outside rather than on screens. Once you start a weekend routine you can tackle the week.
---
I would start really small scaling it back. Like see if you can agree that every night after dinner (this is a good time since they’re fed and already off devices to eat dinner?) there’s 1 hour screen free. You are available and happy to play a game (hide and go seek, cards, drawing, chess, etc.) or go outside (bike, park, baseball, etc) and your wife takes this hour away to do what she wants and isn’t involved. If they do a good job, they can be back on screens after the hour is up, if they fight and freak out, internet’s off until tomorrow. Set the boundary, tell them in advance this is the new screen free time, and stay calm and firm that they need to handle this screen free time or they won’t be back on that night. Start with that, make the hour as fun as it can be, make sure you are engaged and available. And then slowly increase the screen free time. Soon they’ll be having more fun outside playing and ask to stay out later. My kids are similar ages and we have “free time” from school until dinner which can be on screens or anything else, then from dinner at 5 until 7:30 screens are off and go have fun. And then 7:30-8:30pm again they can choose screens or something else until bedtime. In the morning they can have screens once they are dressed and ready for school. With the weather warm now most nights they run in and throws their bags down, and are out playing in the neighbourhood until we drag them in for bed at 8/8:30. If it’s rainy and crappy out they enjoy their screens, but I try to emphasize a lot that something else is always going to be more fun, and screens are there when there’s nothing better to do.
---
Obviously you recognize it, but you guys are doing your kids a horrible disservice. They can't be strangers to technology but they also can't be slaves to it. They're missing out on childhood by always being on a tablet. 

You need to do couples counseling if your wife won't get on the same page. Your kids deserve a childhood unpolluted by screen addiction and because it's gotten so far, the fallout probably won't be easy, but I think you need to just deal with the blowback for a few weeks. Have some great activities planned for your family and also make sure you two aren't exhibiting excessive screen time for your kids to model.",2025-05-14 17:23:19,False
Parenting,young people and social media ban,"Are People Now Against ""Time Out""s? ","I have a 3 year old who is going through a phase of boundary-pushing. When he being really persistently naughty, he'll be made to sit on his stool in his room in eyesight of me (door open) for one or two minutes. He hates the time out and generally when warned he is approaching one, he'll correct course to avoid it, so we only use it a couple times a week (right now - it's only the past month or so we've used it at all, because of this phase he is in of really challenging authority and asserting himself). 

It works pretty well and is clearly not abusive or traumatizing and it doesn't abandon him to his feelings. I'm not putting him on time-out kicking and screaming - when he is having a full blown epic meltdown, we sit and rock together in his chair until he is able to calm down. Time outs are for when he's thrown a toy in the house once... been told not to... twice... been warned next time is time out... throw number three and he's marched to his stool for a minute or two to contemplate his life choices, lol. 

So I'm pretty confused to be seeing some of these articles and social media stuff being very anti-time out. I guess I can understand if it involved locking screaming kids alone in a room - a child who is emotionally out of control needs attendance and containment until they're calm. Or if it was used constantly or the only form of discipline. Usually my boy can comply just through reminders and a firm tone. But for Big Nos like hitting, kicking, pushing, making big messes on purpose, throwing big/hard objects indoors, hurting the dog etc... just a ""no"" is not sufficient, imo. The purpose of the time out as I see it is to kind of force him to stop and collect himself and get himself under better control, as well as to express my significant disapproval. 

What's the deal with the anti time out stuff? What do people suggest be done with the boisterous kids who are hitting, smashing, etc? Not bad or angry kids, just active, limit-testing, passionate little people who want to express themselves, including their healthy aggression, and need grown ups to help them set limits on themselves and learn what is and is not acceptable behavior.

One of the criticisms I saw about it was: if you put them in a room or corner or wherever *alone* then it’s leaving a child to try and process big/overwhelming emotions without any guidance or comfort. I’m not an expert so I don’t know how much weight there is to that concern but it seemed logical so I try to only do timeouts from activities but not from caregiver. I haven’t really had to use time out very much but when I do I just stay with her and offer love and help talk her through what she’s feeling. 

In 10 years they’ll probably research and find that I over-communicated and taught her that she was incapable of processing emotions without relying on another person or something and that’s one of the things that sends my anxiety through the roof to think about 🙃
---
I’ve found *any type of* discipline in general is now being compared to real, actual childhood trauma (not talking about physical discipline). I’m not sure what parents are even “allowed” to do now to discipline outside of talking about their feelings. The idea of punishing your child *at all* for *anything* is becoming taboo. It’s bizarre. 

Your kid will be okay if they are put in time out, lose a toy privilege, get grounded etc or God forbid - you raise your voice at them every once in a while. (Not talking about constant screaming/verbal abuse) kids aren’t made of glass. Actions have consequences and it’s okay to teach them that.

Edit : Anddddd already getting downvoted, lol. Point proven. You mention any type of discipline or punishment and people start foaming at the mouth. I really don’t get it.
---
The social media circles you're referring to like saying ""behavior is communication"", and that my kid's hitting me because she doesn't know how to communicate her anger or frustration or whatever. And I think that's true.

But what they miss is that ""behavior is communication"" is a two-way street. If I tell her it's unacceptable to hit people, but then I accept it, I am communicating that actually is IS okay to hit people. When I tell her she needs to do a four minute time out before I'm willing to do anything else, that communicates that hitting is not okay. When I take away screen privileges, that communicates that her behavior is not okay.

I think the social media people have this idea that if you're a perfect parent, your kid won't hit, or throw, or push boundaries, or intentionally do things you've forbidden just to see what will happen. And there are probably kids out there who are like that just because of their innate personalities. But here in the real world, kids don't always do what parents want, and parents don't always do what kids want, and there is conflict, and someone needs to be in charge of creating and enforcing functional social norms.

Parenting,Australia under 16 social media ban,Teen Cutting for Online Attention ,"I have a 16-year-old, who managed to make her way over to twitter. I get teenagers are curious and they’re gonna do all kinds of things, but now she is embedded herself on a side of Twitter called shtwt. She was influenced there she began cutting. I understand that most people might disagree with me saying that she was influenced, but she told me that she never would’ve done it until she saw people do it online. She stays in this environment where people glamorize it and now she is cutting on a constant basis for this attention that she is getting online. None of it is positive. The community is so toxic. I have seen her two “secret” Twitter accounts, all it is is encouraging these children, these girls, these people, to stay in this unhealthy mindset and behavior, and convince them to keep doing it by giving them attention. I believe that my teen has become addicted to the attention that she is getting and that’s the reason why she continues to do it. 

I have provided resource after resource, healthy hobbies, and opportunities one after the other, but nothing we do can get her away from these people that she has found on twt (and now even instagram) outside of completely taking her access to any form of social media away. *note that I have taken all her social media away but she went into a deep depression and that is how she ended up finding her way to twitter (trying to get around the restrictions on the social media she had that I knew of.) 

I am at my wits end on what to do to help her get away from these negatively, impacting social environments online. 

I’ve talked with her therapist, but in all honesty, I’m terrified to just let her keep going down this path and fear that she might actually end up, hurting herself. 

EDIT TO ADD: 
Obviously there is a whole lot of backstory I didn’t include. I am very aware that there is an underlining issue, and that the “attention” isn’t just it. This is something we’re working on. Unfortunately, I cannot legally take the problem out of her life. Unfortunately, it is going to be a very lengthy things that she/we both have to work through for a long time. 

Next, when I say  “attention” I am not discrediting the fact that she has an underlying issue that made her get to this point. But when she is posting stuff like “ how many followers can I get for some cuts?” or posting a poll like “should I cut today?” Or “I got another message for someone asking me to cut for them, YAY!” Seems for the attention. She even has several posts along the lines of loving the kind of attention she gets on twt. Even so, I KNOW ITS A DEEPER ISSUE, we are working on it. 

I think I maybe I didnt word correctly what I was seeking as far as advice goes. I’m trying to find a balance in giving her a space online that is safe and also trusting her to be safe online. I do not believe that cutting her off is the answer. I’m trying to find a balance. While also helping her get out of and away from this toxic community that she has found. As of right now I think my best course of action is for the time being to remove her from twt, and allow her to keep instagram as long as I can monitor. I know she will spiral from that but it would be near as bad as me taking everything away. Plus this will also hopefully continue to produce a space where she can practice online safety. 

She is in therapy. She has been for 2 years, she only recently got to this point of self harm. She herself told me that she went to twt for one thing (porn 🙄) and ended up on shtwt and it spiraled from there. I take a large portion of the blame for this, because we have the mentality at my house  that if you’re honest, you will not get in trouble and if you communicate things to me, then we can talk about healthy behaviors and courses of action and it was because of this that she told me about her use of twt and I should have done my research before allowing it to continue to be used. I am 100% at fault for not stopping it when she told me about it. I thought it was a community of help and positivity and I was so very wrong and now I am here.

She needs therapy. Mentally well people don't hurt themselves. Mentally unwell people do. You have to actually treat whatever the problem is.


And I would not cut off access to the internet until you talk to a professional. This could very likely make things worse. Someone who has evaluated her is gonna have much better advice than anyone here. 
---
Why does she have access to the internet at all? Sure she needs it for homework, but then it should be monitored. If she was on crack, would you invite her dealer into your house? Cut her off from her fixation. Realize that it isn’t just influence. She has discovered a way of dealing with her inner pain, and she probably won’t stop even if you cut off her twitter. You still need to cut it off though. Listen to her therapist or find one you and her like better. 

When you say healthy hobbies, do you just offer them or do you participate in them?

This may be the wrong way but i’m going to talk about what helped me. Seeing the scarring, talking to people in recovery who regret more than anything how badly it scarred their arms and body, and how it will never go away even if they got it tattooed over. I too cut for attention in middle school and loved the attention it got me at school because i didn’t get any at home. Finally my school therapist got me into a recovery meeting for self harm and hearing so many people / adults talk about how bad they scarred their arms, legs etc and how the scarring damaged their confidence, couldn’t hide it for job interviews, weddings, all of that made me realize holy shit i don’t want that. i don’t want my arms to forever look like that. Unfortunately i got into addiction in my adult hood and got scars all over my arms that way and it’s true; it’s my biggest insecurity. ask her therapist about the self harm meetings, and maybe show her how bad it can actually scar and ruin her body. it never goes away. no magic creams or lasers help. this is permanent and she doesn’t want to be an adult having to explain to everyone for the next 20 years what’s on her arms
---
My eldest started self harming through anxiety and depression. We literally went through the house with a fine tooth comb and boxed up everything that had the potential to cut and then did searches in bags and coats to make sure nothing sharp was being brought into the house. 

Not gonna lie, it was tough going, she even took apart a sharpener to use to cut and would cut either close to her armpits or her inner thighs where it wasn’t easily visible. 

Takes some time to adjust, cutting chicken with a plastic lettuce knife for example but it worked like a charm.

We started with the bark phone and it was one of the best decisions I ever made. My son could call or text me but he couldn’t access the internet or apps on it. It’s a great starter phone.
---
I intended to wait until 8th, and relented in 6th for the bus app/extracurriculars/ safety. We use screentime/downtime/filters and have a parent child cell phone contract. It's set for 3hrs daily including 1 hr youtube. It's a brick at 830pm, and off until 725 am. I still regret it.

I wish I'd gone dumbphone first.

I had a 12-year-old boy on a bike stop me on the street because he was lost (we live in a super safe community) and he wanted to call his mom. He asked if he could use my phone and of course I said yes, then waited with him while his mom drove to pick him up. 

I thought it was so cool that this kid didn’t have a phone but felt empowered to approach a safe-looking stranger and problem-solve. So many kids are terrified of talking to strangers, don’t know how to judge “safe” from “unsafe” or sketchy looking, and wouldn’t have a clue how to get out of a jam without a personal cell phone. 

Sharing as I think this is an unconventional reason to not get a phone too early. This kid was able to have a really nice conversation with me while we waited and was super polite and thankful. Those are the skills should be developing.

If the only childhood trauma she has some day is that she had to wait for a cell phone, I don't think that's the worst trauma in the world. Unfiltered and unlimited access to a phone, I wouldn't. My son's only a toddler, but when he gets the age of having a phone, he'll be lucky if he's getting the old folks jitterbug phone.

AustralianPolitics,age verification social media Australia,Australian Twitter is basically just a conservative site now. ,"Australian Twitter is basically shoving Australian conservatism and conservatives in my face from all parties non stop. So i'm guessing this is a new emerging strategy from the fallout of the US elections taking place here?  
  
I do fear American styled politics taking root here, since politics here i feel revolves around economics. And whilst it's not perfect, and people and parties often lie and sloganeer to fit their agenda. It's still not as insane as American style politics. 

The amount of anti Albo, pro UAP, LNP or ON posts is insane. From groups such as the 'Australian MAGA group' (christ sakes). 

I find it sad how hijacked our politics and social media can become by foreign influence. Of which, American politics is so divisive and frankly schizophrenic I don't blame half of them for not knowing what's happening half the time. 

Both sides placate to thee lowest common denominator, but conservatives are so good at playing with peoples fear and hate it's kinda scary to think that X or Twitter could influence our elections in the worst way possible. 

The difference between political wings here atleast is night and day. It goes from Greens, Labor or LCA it focuses on housing, cost of living, medicare upgrades or meeting world leaders. 

Pretty bland stuff. 

But on the opposite side of the spectrum it's this 'take back Australia', X group wants to do Y thing too you or just conspiracies. At the lightest i'll see Dutton here and there talk about a social media ban or nuclear reactors. 

What do you think gang? Do you think Elon could potentially worsen our political climate? I know it's not Sunday. But i'm bored and wanted to at least see what people think about Twitter or X utterly spamming people with right wing parties and people.

I administer Zscaler for SMB’s and similar SASE or ZTNA products. While I agree with the general sentiment about not logging into personal accounts on a work machine, as long as you don’t do it in the same managed browser profile as your work account, we don’t care from the admin perspective.

Zscaler does install a root cert and does give admins the ability to decrypt all SSL traffic. That’s going forward though, and not retroactive. We can see all your browsing history though, so be cognizant of where you’re browsing. 

This is not a keylogger though, and it doesn’t give us the ability to see your email contents, photos, documents, or file contents. 

As long as you aren’t looking at child porn, or visiting malware ridden sites, IT really doesn’t care. It’s the meddling managers looking for a reason to fire someone you need to worry about.

I see that one of the things zscaler does is installing root certificates to decrypt tls connections; that does *not* allow them to decrypt older traffic, even in the extremely unlikely eventuality that they recorded it.


However being a company computer, probably part of an active directory domain or similar things,  they in all likelihood already had ways to see and access everything you do (and maybe there even already were certificates for doing the same thing)

I was a bit like this as a kid (though older than 11) and to be perfectly honest, I needed someone to take away my internet access
---
As someone who was, to be honest, into Otherkin stuff as a young teen in the early internet.  I just want to let you know that you can grow up to be a totally normal and functional adult after this.  It's not necessarily something that should be putting you in crisis mode.  On a personal level, I was also bullied and feeling lost and feeling like I didn't fit in but also had a pretty crappy home life.  It was a way for me to develop an identity and have a support and peer group.  

I think there are concerns these days because these pseudo social support groups pop up very readily in social media and kids can get really wrapped up in them and that's totally valid, but I don't know if you need to worry yet.  It's great that you have started therapy but just know this can just be a ""normal"" phase too, even if it seems a little out there to you.
---
I would focus on the bullying and just roll with the therian / aro / ace stuff.  Accept it as she comes up with it, ask questions as they occur to you, but I wouldn't get too hung up on it yet.   The therian thing could have even come up from a desperate google search ""what if I wanted to be an animal instead of a human"" and it might have popped up.    I have adult friends who are aro/ace and they're fine.  

As for the bullying, that's going to require a lot of role playing and practicing with her.  Bullies pick on her because at the moment, she's an appealing target.  Whether it's the wild claims she's making or because she reacts when they do, I don't know, but you want to teach her how to be a less ""rewarding"" (re: not as ego boosting as the bullies want) target.   And a lot of that involves learning how to fire back and stand up for yourself.   You'll usually have to sit down with her, figure out what the bullies are saying, and workshop and roleplay responses that will shut them down.   If you have more insight on that, we can also help you come up with ideas. 

I would also focus on getting her a social haven away from school.  It could be an extracurricular sport or activity, or a volunteer activity you do together.   Something where she can spread her wings a bit and be herself (is there any youth drama productions in the area? They can be dramatic little weirdos with each other).   

What DOES she like?  Is there any groups you can join with her do to that thing under supervision?  (I'm assuming she likes an activity that normally older teens or adults are more commonly into?)
---
i have no idea what a therian is, but at 11, you *should* be asexual and it’s common to be aromantic (i mean at that age you’re still playing with barbie’s and toys) so i wouldn’t stress about it. i also wouldn’t punish her for it. 

if it is a phase, she’ll be more stubborn to grow out of if and want to stay the same out of spite to prove she’s right, but if you just let her do her thing it’ll pass.

i’m trans and i’ve been out as trans since i was 12, i’ve seen some people identify as some unusual identities when we were 12-15 but they’re well adjusted adults now. some still identify as trans, some realized that the identity never actually fit them. and that’s okay, part of being a kid is exploring yourself.

to me, it’s very much like an emo phase. some of the emo kids are “normal” preppy adults and some have invested into the goth life style.   let her be and she’ll be fine i’m sure of it.

honestly, i’d much prefer my daughter to identify as aroace at 11 then be hyper sexual like i was and make the mistakes i made when it comes to sex and relationships i did",2024-10-06 00:38:17,False

AskAnAustralian,young people and social media ban,"Asian Australians, how ""Australian"" do you feel?","As a Chinese Australian who grew up here, I've never fully felt ""standard Australian"" in a white Anglo-Australian sense. Most of my friends are other Chinese/Asian Australians and we are definitely different to bulk White Australians to the extent that we might as well be different demographics at this stage. I feel a sense of distance to White Australians, which was especially evident during university. Many Asian Australians tend to feel excluded in classes because white Aussies would oftentimes ignore us or passive aggressively talk with each other. Asian Australians seem to also do this as well, to be honest.

In terms of interests or the media I watch, I mostly consume Korean/Japanese media along with Hollywood generic stuff. I'm very removed from local Australian media and politics, of which I care very little about?

I do notice that Asian Australian sub-groups differ in how ""Australian"" they present. For example, Filipino Australians seem more or less in the same social circle with white people. But Australian born Chinese from Mainland China in selective schools might as well be their own Australian subculture at this point. Most of us can't really make friends with Chinese internationals or mainstream White Australians. Our friend groups are usually this pan-Asian Australian mixed group with specific interests and experiences that others may not understand.

Ultimately, I think I definitely feel ""Australian"", but just a different type of Australian.

Edit: For the average Chinese or Asian Australian, I think it can be rather easy to befriend certain rural/regional white Australians, rather than certain grammar school preppy ""my dad is a lawyer"" types. My observation is that the latter group seems more cliquey and hard to ""break into"".

Filipino Australians are in the same circle with white people -- this part is interesting. I'm Filipino-Japanese Aussie. I dont really read much into circles. I'm married to an Aussie. I just go with people who like me. And im also an introvert so its not like it bothers me a lot if i dont have a social circle either. However, I did notice that Filipino Aussies get on well with both Asians and non-Asians. But i think its more because of how we are brought up. Everybody is welcomed. We like being warm towards people and even generous sometimes. Most who I know live here have brought Filipino food at work and shared with everybody. And in schools they mix with different groups but also come home to a Filipino household where they still get to enjoy their own culture. We also tend to not force people to understand our culture and way of thinking. But we try to adapt to who we are surrounded by. Also, the Philippines is multi-cultural so being friends with people from different backgrounds is not new to us. The Philippines also has a long history being colonised by Spaniards for 300 years which exposed us to their culture and religion, but we have close ties to America and speak their language very well but also have lots of Chinese, Koreans, Japanese and Indians living there that we are exposed to their culture, religion and food.

Very. I mean, I live in Australia. I work with mostly non-Asian people. Heaps of my friends through hobbies or school aren't Chinese (although plenty from my uni were). I'm writing in English and read traditional English-language media. My voting options are white peeps. 

Let me be real: you have this weirdly reductionist attitude that comes through most from you using the phrases ""bulk White Australians"" or ""mainstream White Australians"". The fact is that people in Australia come in all shapes and sizes. Take any subgroup, whether it's Chinese-Australians from selective schools or white Young Liberals or people living in rural areas and there'll be some sense of distance from everyone outside the sub-group. The model of ""Chinese-Australians"" vs ""mainstream White Australia"" is so off. It's more like hundreds of overlapping subgroups.

Saying ""most of us can't really make friends with Chinese internationals or mainstream White Australians"" sounds so defeatist and sad, dude. I don't think it's true, either. All of you (Chinese-descent selective school kids) can make friends with anyone with the right attitude and actions. Learn how to socialise at the pub or at a run club or sport. Or find a way to invite people into your niche interests. And you know, stop hanging out on Asian masculinity subreddits and spend more time in the real world.

Also Asian Australian. I consider myself equally both but that means sometimes you meet other people who will never consider me ""one of them"", also equally on both sides. It took me some time but I'm 100% ok with that.

My experience is the opposite. I’ve found that Asian-Australians, and Asians in general, tend to be a lot more cliquey, and primarily socialise with people who belong to the same culture/nationality.

Parenting,kids off social media,Feeling discouraged after seeing a “perfect kid” post.

The post listed his achievements going all the way back to childhood and was filled with religious language. For example: *“Harvard was the school God had prepared for you.”*

I know he’s proud, and rightfully so. But the whole post came across like he was flexing this perfect, high-achieving kid, all framed as part of some divine plan. Instead of feeling inspired, I just felt... defeated

I’m in the thick of it with my own kids, especially my teenage son with school struggles, low motivation, self-esteem issues.

I know social media only shows the highlight reel, but it still stings.

You’re not failing.  Stop comparing your kids and definitely stop comparing them to social media posts that only include the highlight reel.

**10) Work From Home**     
Claimed he'd end work from home for public servants, [then walked the policy back when downsizing/offshoring public services turned out to be unpopular.](https://archive.is/7q16Q)

Shadow DOGE is without a doubt my favourite of things he did while high on Trump's farts. It makes no bloody sense to say you're creating a shadow DOGE when a shadow position is meant to critique a post in government. Really looked like a kissing up to Trump moron with that one.

The one thing these all have in common is that they all lack detail.

Either they have not done the modelling, done the costings (both to implement and the cost/benefit for the tax-payers) or they have but won't release them.

A lot of these are simply buzzwords or temperature testing to see if they can gain traction with the voters.

Also none of these policies together add up to a clear plan or direction on where they want to steer the country in 3 years. It is almost as if they think they are still in Government and the Labor party is simply 'minding the shop' so to speak.

AskAnAustralian,young people and social media ban,Has anyone here ever had a friend who you used to talk to quite often but then one day they dropped off the planet never to be heard from again?,"Many years ago I was listening to a podcast. This podcast was a Q&A session that a podcast with a very large team was doing. They did both the podcast but also ran a website so many different people were involved in keeping things going

They were answering a question about team members who had left and they spoke about their graphics guy who was insanely talented and they thought really high of and he was an online friend of the creator and he then says “suddenly one day he was gone” and they genuinely never heard from him again. He just disappeared from social media entirely hadn’t updated/responded to messages. People in the team genuinely wondered if he had passed away but there was no official proof there because nobody put up a post about it. 

He just simply vanished 

Now admittedly when I first heard this podcast episode I was laughing my head off at the story and the podcasters were too but as I’ve gotten older I’ve reflected on that and realised that may not have been a laughing matter and hopefully that person was ok 

So it made me wonder has this ever happened to anyone else? Have you ever had a friend that just proper disappeared one day?

I had a friend who lived in a different country to me. We spoke every day for four years and then one day he just....vanished. I don't know if he ghosted me or if something happened but I had no way of finding out. It was awful. I grieved but also felt strangely angry and guilty at the same time. I didn't know what to feel. We were so close and he just disappeared. To this day I don't know if I'm more worried about him or angry at him.

Yep. I’m the one that’s dropped off, and I’ve had it happen to me. I was bullied at work for about 18 months and had to walk out of my job. I’m trying to pick up the pieces and I’ve completely cut communication with most people. I get insanely stressed when I receive messages from people and can’t bring myself to check them. It’s just too overwhelming. I even shut off reddit for the past couple of weeks because I had a bunch of notifications. 


Sometimes people need space to “digest” life and pick themselves back up. Sometimes people need distance from people who make them feel like crap and people that are only fair weather friends. I have “friends” who can’t/won’t offer an ear or support when you tell them what’s going on, but they’ll expect you to drop absolutely everything for them if they’re going through a hard time. Also I have friends that mean well, but when they try to show empathy it just ends up being shown in a way that makes you feel pathetic and much worse about yourself and your predicament; it could be their tone of voice, or those utterly useless sayings like “oh well it could be worse” before trying to convince you their life is worse than yours.

Yes. Bloke that shared trips to Bathurst, beach holidays, etc. He won the lottery back in the 70’s. The amount would be multimillions in today’s money. After a year or so of certain folk chasing him for money, he simply disappeared. I was reasonably close, but even his best friend from school days has no idea where he went. Neither of us ever asked him for money.

Parenting,online safety for teenagers,My teenage daughter ran away today,"For context, I'm a single mom with kids ages 14,9 and 5. We escaped my husband due to domestic abuse few years ago,and I have a boyfriend now living with us. So, Wed morning, my daughter (14F)shouted at me as the house is noisy at 11am (she wants to sleep because she always stay up late using her phone, she always walks out at night time too without my knowledge) and my BF asked her calmly why she always shouting at me,having no respect to me as her mom. She stayed on her room after that and I brought her food yesterday and threaten her calmly that I will get her phone if she will continue to stay up so late (but I actually didnt do it) so fast forward today, I woke up at 4am because her friend chatted me and sending my daughter's location. We went to that location and cant find her. I made a Group Chat with all her friends and they sent me her messages to them. I also asked her friends to let her in even just for today instead of just walking in unknown places. She always ran away when she gets reprimanded (and I never hit her, never shouted to her, and I'm always calm when I talk to her). Should I just give her some space and break up with my BF? As I think the BF is the reason that my daughter is like this. She replied to my texts too, saying that she just wants to be away for awhile. I'm really worried about her safety. Any advice from anyone who have teenager kids will be greatly appreciated! 🙏 bash me all you want, I won't mind.

PS
She's a sweet kid, and I always give her everything that she needs and gives in with her requests etc. My friends thinks I spoiled her too much. She didn't brought any clothes or wallet so she doesn't have any money with her, only her phone.



UPDATE: She's home now (after I told her in text that I love her, she went home in her own will) and talked to her heart to heart (privately), she said BF is never the problem (as I asked her too before BF moved in and she's okay with it, they get along well too and treats him already as a stepfather). I might be the reason, as she said that I don't want her anymore and I sense some jealousy in her voice. Thank you for all the advice, even the hurtful comments. I appreciate it.

UPDATE 2: After my daughter and I had talked privately, I talked to my BF to move out ASAP and he's now one city away from us (despite the cries of my younger kids). He fully understands the situation and left immediately. I am contacting therapists in our area but they are so expensive.

And why did you let him? Especially after leaving a DV situation with her dad?

It sounds like she’s hurting. I am betting you all need some family therapy to work through the trauma.

Furthermore, you said he is living with you. How long has that been? It’s probably too soon for her. Is he ever alone with the kids? Is he mean to them? Does he creep her out? 

You need to ask a lot of questions, and follow through on things you say you’ll do, like taking her phone. She shouldn’t be on it all night or walking out at night.

I think your daughter is extremely uncomfortable with your BF living there. Given that this app gets dozens of posts daily from teenaged girls being perved on by their mother’s live-in BF or husband, and their mother refuses to believe them 99% of the time, I’d try speaking to your daughter privately to see if that might be happening here. If not, then there are other reasons she is uncomfortable with him, and family therapy is warranted.

AustralianPolitics,young people and social media ban,"Gen Z aren’t voting left or right, they want to smash the system","**PAYWALL:**

It’s not that young constituents are embracing xenophobia or reactionary politics. But as economic insecurity and inequality grow, they will take a chance on anyone who may destroy the status quo.

The election will be a ballot of many firsts and a last. Anthony Albanese is seeking to become the first prime minister since John Howard in 1998 to be re-elected to serve a second term. If successful, he will join Labor heroes Gough Whitlam (1974) and Bob Hawke (1984) as the only federal ALP leader to do so after taking the party out of opposition.

Barring a miracle or, for some, a catastrophe, Albo is our last Boomer PM. Henceforth, any change to the occupant of The Lodge won’t be a matter of “OK, Boomer” but rather “Outta our way, OK”.

Should Peter Dutton triumph against the odds, he would be our second Gen X prime minister after Scott Morrison. It is possible that the prime minister to succeed Albanese, should he win the election and then choose to vacate, will skip a generation to the Gen Y/Millennials.

We are witnessing a generational takeover. The election will be the first where Gen Z and Millennials outnumber Boomers in every state and territory. This demographic earthquake is shattering the old way of doing politics: changing who we elect, and how parties campaign.

Then there is the so-called “Trump bump”. Incumbents of the left and right had been turfed from office in the years after COVID-19 due to inflation and the global cost-of-living crisis. But in 2025, incumbents living in Donald Trump’s world are reaping political dividends.

Australians don’t much like the Donald, and he is particularly toxic with younger voters.

As an Australia-first John Curtin Research Centre study of voters aged 18 to 44 shows, young Australians loathe the idea of a Down Under Donald. Only 12 per cent say Australia would “definitely benefit” and 11 per cent say “probably” – a view shared by most young Liberal voters.

Our survey reveals something more unsettling. Young Australians don’t want a Trump, but they are angry with an establishment they associate with a rigged economic system. Overseas, they have flocked to anti-establishment right-wingers, from Trump to Argentina’s Javier Milei.

In Europe, hard-right populists are winning over young voters who feel betrayed by the mainstream, from the Netherlands to traditional left-wing strongholds such as Sweden. Conversely, left-wing populism briefly surged in support of Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn.

There is no Australian exceptionalism. Young voter cohorts have known little beyond economic flux, uncertainty, and growing inequality since entering the workforce. Buffeted by the global financial crisis of 2008-09, enduring a decade of anaemic economic growth, stagnant wages, and a housing crisis, all worsened by COVID-19, young Australians feel abandoned by establishment parties.

Among young men in their mid-to-late 20s, the trend is particularly acute and dangerous. They are attracted to a radical-right narrative that frames mainstream politics as corrupt, incompetent, and indifferent.

Reflecting other polling, Labor comfortably leads 60.5 per cent to 39.5 per cent on a two-party preferred basis, and the Greens pick up one in every five young voters and, perhaps surprisingly, nearly one in 10 for One Nation.

Anthony Albanese fares relatively well among young voters, but for Dutton, the feedback from young voters is ominous. Our survey reveals he is far less trusted than Albanese, scores lower than US right-wing podcaster Joe Rogan, and ranks just above Trump.

The only two figures who receive net positive trust scores are former centre-left politicians Barack Obama and Jacinda Ardern. No serving politician in Australia has a net positive trust rating from voters aged 18 to 44. Yet danger looms for Labor – the Greens’ Max Chandler-Mather and Adam Bandt are the most trusted active politicians among young voters.

Anti-establishment politics transcends traditional left and right. Young voters who scored the highest on the populist scale were the least likely to support major parties. Instead, they gravitated toward minor parties and independents, including the Greens on the left (26 per cent) and One Nation (13 per cent) to the right.

They are not straightforwardly right-wing or left-wing, conservative or progressive. They exhibit progressive views on social issues such as gender roles, but express grave scepticism towards immigration. 

However, the latter view isn’t informed by racism. It’s one thing to support immigration in principle, but when they see unchecked population growth smashing housing affordability and wages, it’s another story.

These young voters aren’t primarily animated by “wokeism” or culture wars. Their grievances are material – housing, jobs, and living standards. The cost of living is the top concern for young Australians, with 83 per cent ranking it among their top three issues, and 50 per cent deeming it the most important issue. Housing affordability follows closely behind, with 48 per cent of young voters identifying it as a top concern.

Health, climate change, and even crime are secondary concerns, but they are still significant for a large portion of the young electorate. Crucially, Gen Y and Z voters have little confidence in governments acting on their concerns.

Win or lose, our survey is a wake-up call all parties must heed. It’s not that young voters are embracing xenophobia or reactionary politics. But as economic insecurity and inequality grow, they will take a chance on anyone who promises to smash the system.

Young people’s anger won’t be soothed with progressive platitudes or more of the same mainstream conservatism, nor “Trumpism lite”. The anti-establishment mood isn’t a passing phase.

The biggest lesson is for the mainstream left. If it fails to deliver material change, the right will exploit voter frustration, as will the Greens. The ALP was born out of and sustained by working-class grievances with the establishment and righting injustice. It must channel this sentiment today, or young Australians will seek answers elsewhere.

That future, whatever the short-term Trump bump, is one where young voters look left, right, and anywhere else.",163,221,NoLeafClover777,https://www.afr.com/politics/move-over-boomer-gen-z-aren-t-voting-left-or-right-they-want-to-smash-the-system-20250402-p5loi0,2025-04-22 08:07:27,"**Greetings humans.**

Pretty sure by 'smash the system' they mean 'break the two-party stranglehold & try someone else', not 'totally tear down Australian society and hope for anarchy instead' like many of the comments in here seem to think...

I'm not Gen Z and I want to smash it, too.  We are in an appalling state of affairs, willfully blind or indifferent to the damage we are doing to the current and future generations.   Those voting to protect their ability to tax-effectively hoard assets and protect their wealth with no regard to generational equity should be ashamed.   It needs to be smashed to allow a new paradigm to emerge.

Off-topic, but this new Reddit feature where you can actually post the content of articles in the OP along with a link is pretty sweet... I'll try and include all paywalled content from the AFR in it in future posts (I pay for the AFR).

On-topic, pretty much what I was saying the other day - majors' vote share likely to continue to decline amongst Gen Y/Z, with Greens to benefit but it's not *just* purely to them. Sums up the increased polarisation as younger people just want whatever non-status-quo option they can find that aligns with their beliefs, largely curated by their online echo chamber of choice.

Going to be some very interesting numbers coming out of this election IMO.

>the Greens pick up one in every five young voters

Worth noting that with young voters the female Green vote is MUCH higher than the male Green vote.

The article posted here a few hours ago on the Greens wanting to close the gender pay gap (which I think has now been deleted) was filled with comments critical of the Greens wanting to do this. I thought this was a great example of why the young voters have such a significant gender difference in who  they vote for.",2025-04-22 08:07:27,False
Parenting,age verification social media Australia,15 year old sneaking out and sleeping with others,"my 15 year old has been sneaking out and smoking wax pens/vapes. This started when she was 14. I locked down her phone restricted who she can talk to. I have her in extra curriculares, soccer at the high school, and spent quality time with her. I recently found out when she sneaked out she has slept with a significantly older guy twice. I am doing everything I can. I even have her older sister talking to her and monitoring her accounts while I do more in person consequences. I found out recently that she lied about the guys age and started doing this again. I have taken social media away. She cannot even download it on her phone. I’m at a loss. What should/can i do? I just want her to behave better and not put herself in danger. Her father and I are still married and have a good relationship. We have family game night to bond. The only difference in the house is her older sister went away to college and isn’t home as often. 

edit: 
thank you for all of your advice. i say i am “looking” into therapy due to there being extremely long waitlists and trying to find places is hard. Her phone is locked down so she can only text family when she needs to be picked up from practice from school. There are no second devices her room has been searched and she didn’t know it was searched cause she was at school and i made sure everything was back where it was. 

edit: 
of course im reporting the guy. I wouldn’t let my daughter be abused like that and do nothing about it. The guy is 20 and was 19 when it started. I tried the non-restrictive approach and hearing her out and everything before but that did not work. The family game nights aren’t required and are only done if the kids ask and don’t have a required day or time. Usually the way they happen is one of the kids saying I want to play games tonight and you can say yes or no to playing. Often times it rotates which kid doesn’t want to play but they usually all do. Again, it is never forced and she is usually the one asking to play games after school. Also, her dad is in the picture and we have no plans of getting divorced and we are happy. She has a relationship with him and they have one on one time.  Also, my worry right now is not about her having sex it’s about who she is having it with. She is on birth control and has had the hpv vaccine and everything. My main focus is how to get her to stop these behaviors that are putting her in danger not to get her to stop having sex. i’m aware teenagers will find ways to have sex if they want to.

Restrictions alone won’t solve this. Locking down her phone, cutting off social media, and assigning her sister to watch over her may temporarily plug the holes, but they’re band-aids on a much bigger wound.

What you’re facing here is not just rebellious behavior; it’s a young person screaming for control, independence, and…dare I say it…validation, albeit in some very risky ways. Her sneaking out and seeking out significantly older men isn’t just about bad choices. It’s about trying to fill a need for attention or connection that, for some reason, isn’t being met in healthier ways.

The tough reality? You can’t control her every move. She’ll find ways around your lockdowns, and she’ll lie, as you’ve already seen. You have to address the why behind this behavior…what’s going on inside her head, and why is she seeking out this level of risk?

Here’s what you can do:

Stop playing the jailer and start being the investigator. Instead of locking everything down tighter, open up more conversations that are actually about her. Don’t just lecture her about consequences…she knows those by now. Ask her what’s going on inside her, who she’s looking for validation from, and why.

Get real about trust. Right now, you and she are locked in a trust war. If you double down on punishment without a relationship reset, you’re going to lose. You need to let her know she has some agency in rebuilding the trust she’s broken, but it starts with her opening up, too.

Therapy, therapy, therapy. You can’t tackle this alone. She needs a professional to help her process whatever emotional void is driving this behavior. Family game nights are nice, but they don’t unpack deep-seated issues of self-worth, rebellion, or dangerous choices.

Let her feel the weight of real consequences. Not just your consequences…because those can feel arbitrary…but the actual dangers she’s putting herself in. Maybe that means bringing in someone who can speak to the real risks of vaping or sleeping with older men…someone outside the family who can make these risks feel tangible, not like a distant lecture from mom.

You love her; that’s obvious. But love also means facing that you can’t control her into safety…you have to guide her into it, even when she’s making choices that scare you.

If the significantly older guy was 18+, please consider contacting police for statutory rape.      When i was 15/16 I was so lost.  I was groomed by a man 10 yrs older.     I was the typical stupid ""look how mature I am that I attracted much older men"".    My parents did nothing.    Men who use girls this age tend to be men who want to control,  use, and abuse.    Do whatever you have to scare those nasty predatory men away.  

I recommend getting her into therapy.   A lot of the draw to sex for girls this age is the validation.     The drug use is self medication.    Address the why she's doing both rather than trying to control the behavior with punish.    You probably should do both solo and family counseling. Family counseling can improve the relationship she has with you two and give you specific ideas on how to respond to her poor choices.   If wait list for solo counseling is crazy long, consider driving outside your area or doing telemedicne .   

Make it harder for her to sneak out without anyone noticing.  A door alarm or a Ring type camera could notify you and your spouse anytime there's someone coming or going.",2024-10-21 05:39:19,False
AustralianPolitics,young people and social media ban,News Corp queries audience ‘independence’ after Albanese declared debate winner,"Article:

News Corp’s top political minds declared Peter Dutton the clear winner of its paywalled leader’s election debate on Tuesday night, despite the independently selected audience of 100 undecided voters favouring Anthony Albanese.

The People’s Forum broadcast, hosted by Sky News Australia and The Daily Telegraph, was available only to those with a paid subscription to either Foxtel, Sky News’s digital platform, one of News Corp’s major mastheads, or in some selected regional markets.

Albanese won the debate according to a poll of the 100 undecided voters at the debate.

This means it’s unlikely a complete and final audience viewing figure will be available from an independent ratings agency. About 175,000 Australians tuned in to the 2022 version and a Sky spokesperson said it would share a cross-platform figure by Thursday afternoon.

News Corp’s top political commentators immediately cast doubt on the political leanings of its audience’s profile, which had a 100-person panel made up of “undecided voters”, selected by independent firm Q&A Market Research.

The Telegraph’s Ray Hadley said he was “baffled” and left “questioning the objectivity” of some of the voters.

The audience declared Anthony Albanese the winner, with a margin of 44 to Dutton’s 35, while 21 remained undecided. In 2022, the People’s Forum handed then opposition leader Albanese the win over Scott Morrison, albeit by a closer margin of 40-35.

As the debate this year was behind a paywall, most of the electorate was left to rely on the accounts of different media outlets to decipher who came out on top. Outside News Corp, Australia’s largest publisher of news, most determined it a narrow Albanese win, or a draw.

Editor of The Telegraph Ben English and Sky’s political editor, Andrew Clennell, also questioned the audience, with the latter calling Dutton the “clear winner”.
Among the questions from the audience, one voter from Western Sydney asked both leaders on their approach to the ongoing conflict in Gaza, which led Hadley to voice his doubt over her status as an undecided voter, “given the tone of her question”, he told The Daily Telegraph.

Sky’s website on Wednesday morning said the prime minister had failed to win over the majority of voters, despite winning the audience vote.

Five of The Australian’s expert panel of seven handed Dutton the win, with one for Albanese and one for a draw, while two of The Age and Sydney Morning Herald’s panel called a draw, with Jacqueline Maley handing Albanese the win. The Telegraph’s national affairs editor, James Morrow, national weekend political editor James Campbell and political editor for The Australian Simon Benson all handed Dutton the win.

Before the result was delivered on Paul Murray Live on Tuesday evening, the Liberal National Party’s official social media account had declared Dutton the winner.

Dutton and Albanese will go head-to-head in a debate again next week, on April 16, live from the ABC’s new Parramatta studios, hosted by David Speers, but they are yet to agree on a potential two further debates. Channel Nine and Seven have made formal bids to host their own debate ahead of polling day on May 3.

Next week’s debate on the public broadcaster will deliver a significantly larger audience, but the spectacle of the two-person face-off has become more of a campaign set piece, rather than an event that will persuade voters one way or another, says Resolve pollster Jim Reed.

“They’re more or less expected, and if you refuse to take part in a debate, I think you look a bit weak or scared. So it’s something that they’re more or less obliged to do. Is there great value in them? That’s a bit of a question mark,” Reed says.

In an increasingly stage-managed affair, the focus is rather to avoid anything going wrong and hope the opponent slips up, he adds.

“The most likely impact on a campaign is actually when things go wrong, and it’s probably why the leaders’ offices and the campaign offices agree all the details of the debates well in advance.

“It’s really about de-risking the debate for them, and hoping your opponent makes a mistake.”

Sky will host a second debate on Wednesday night between Treasurer Jim Chalmers and his challenger, shadow treasurer Angus Taylor.

Futurology,young people and social media ban,How do you predict the dead internet is going to evolve?,"For a definition, read the wikipedia article: [dead internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory).

My current observations are:

* **Twitter**: Is gonna be the first social media network to fall into the dead internet. The short message format and an audience already acustomized to branded / with no real photo profiles, combined with the lack of any kind of moderation, make it the perfect target. It's safe to say as much as 60%+ of Twitter is currently AI bots.
* **Reddit**: The first objective will be unmoderated, or poorly moderated subs of cities, states, and related with politics. On a second phase, botters will create communities entirely composed by bots. People will join on their own because they will be undistinguishable from regular communities, except from the fact they are bigger. There are many protective elements on Reddit though, like the fact it is mostly a multimedia content platform.
* **Facebook**: Facebook could be a hard nut to crack for AI. At least entirely. While it's true a big part of FB content is low quality inspirational phrases and memes, the fact accounts are based on real identities makes relatively easy to identify fake accounts. On the other side, FB audence is older, lonlier, and easier to manipulate, so we are likely to experience a situation with a high amount of bots, but their reach is gonna be much lower than twitter bots for a while because of how the FB algorithm work.
* **Instagram**: Real user accounts are very easy to identify. But that's not the case for feed content, which is the majority of the content people consume. We will see a big increase of bot activity on IG during this year.

That's my take anyway. Do you agree? Do you disagree? What are your predictions?",157,146,Zeioth,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1cye7lx/how_do_you_predict_the_dead_internet_is_going_to/,2024-05-22 23:10:48,"If you’ve been in Facebook lately it is already a zombie site, it is just post after post of obvious ai bots talking with other bots

I don't agree with your thoughts on Reddit or Facebook.

It's not at all hard to make a fake Facebook profile, even though it might violate their TOS. 

For Reddit, there already are massive numbers of bots, and some communities have already been quite swamped. And some communities are nowhere near dead. So I think that your prediction has already come to pass. It wouldn't surprise me at all if some bots completely take over more subs--or, conversely, if some subs are reclaimed from the bots.

Overall, though, as long as there are people who want to contribute to the internet, I definitely think that they will always find or make places to do so.",2024-05-22 23:10:48,False

Banning cell phones in schools is good. Don’t group this in with banning books.

I can absolutely agree with banning phones during class time, but what the hell does it accomplish to ban books and limit history lessons? Cellphones distract from learning, so the solution is to *checks notes* limit their learning even more?

These kids have every right to be furious. They are going to be missing vital parts of their education by limiting what they are allowed to learn about. Florida is setting these kids up for failure, and is by no means even attempting to create an educated society by limiting what these kids are learning. 

This is shameful, and disgusting.

Seems sensible. 

My state has just recently banned phones at all during the school day in public schools. Kids turn them off at 8:45 and turn them back on at 3:01. It’s been wonderful. Kids aren’t distracted in class. They aren’t importing drama from other students during class time. And they are actually talking to each other during break times. 

Social media should be the same. The benefits to teens are limited, but he harm can be significant.

Parenting,young people and social media ban,I can't believe that Erica Komisar is popular,"**Second Edit:** So sorry to do this, I just wanted to put a very nuanced video here that covers much of the problems I had with the podcast Erica was on. Please give it a watch if you're going to post something Pro-Komisar.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSTihDlhTo0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSTihDlhTo0)

**Edit**: I wanted to thank everyone who pointed me towards valid criticism of Emily Oster, I have only read two of her books, which were well cited, but it seems that valid knowledge does not keep us safe from grifting.

**I also wanted to state that I'm in a place of luxury that many cannot afford to have, I am a SAHM that will never need to work unless many, many, many terrible things happen in my current life. I was simply furious at Erica Komisar for placing the blame primarily at parents instead of at corporations and administrations that have the real power to help parents. I understand that sacrifices need to be made when we are born into parenthood, but so many stressors could be nullified if America only prioritized our children like we do.**

I think social media really presents us with the worst and best of parenting, where all we see is either extreme neglect, or influencers showing off how much they do for their kids. We need to remember that most parents are deep in the muck of it, doing their best, knowing that our country could really help us out via maternity/paternity leave, affordable healthcare, free education, etc.

Original Post:  
For those of you who don't know Erica Komisar, turn back now and be happy you haven't heard her inane babblings. She's a religious conservative that wants to make sure women know that their place is at home and should be fully sacrificial in their devotion towards their children. She's a glorified social worker that reads research on small studies that do nothing more than confirm her own internal bias. I hate that tiktok and so much of social media is just smothered with conservative beliefs that condemn women if they try to do anything other than stare at their children all day.

If you feel the same way that I do about Erica Komisar, I'd highly recommend reading Emily Oster's books on parenting, that all have conclusions based on huge double-blind studies with large sample sizes. Nothing against people with religious beliefs, but fear-mongering women into acting a certain way because you're trying to make them believe that they're ""giving ADHD, Depression and Anxiety"" to their children by putting them in daycare is a crock of shit.",148,288,BlossomingSun_,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1j3mu6g/i_cant_believe_that_erica_komisar_is_popular/,2025-03-04 21:59:10,"Social media is one of the most damaging things of our lifetime

I’m very curious about where you got this impression of her. I just watched her interview on diary of a ceo and that is not at all what I got from it. She herself has a career and doesn’t advocate for women not being working moms full stop, just prioritizing those first three years. And she advocates for doing that through paid parental leave. I dont think it’s fear mongering to say that putting your 6 week old baby in daycare and seeing them 2 hours a day 5 days a week could damage them from an emotional and attachment perspective. It’s kind of common sense when you understand the biological needs of an infant for connection. I don’t think parents should be blamed for that because most have no other choice, it’s a problem with the system we have in America and she acknowledges that quite clearly. I just don’t think it can be argued that the current system we have for parental leave and the division of labor particularly for working parents is good? She’s advocating for changing that to improve the lives of parents and children so I’m not sure how you think that’s a bad thing?
---
She is here to shine a light on an uncomfortable truth. As a working mom, a Democrat, and an agnostic living in New York, I enjoy my job—but I can’t ignore the fact that placing my child in daycare wasn’t the best thing for her. It may have been beneficial for me, but not for my baby. I witnessed attachment issues and sadness in her eyes after long hours apart. Then COVID hit, and thankfully, I was able to work from home. Since then, I’ve seen a remarkable shift in her behavior—she’s happier, less anxious, and more secure.

There’s an undeniable biological and evolutionary truth here. Social media glamorizes long working hours and portrays being a ""strong, independent working woman"" as admirable. But glorifying relentless work at the expense of our children isn’t the right path. I’m not saying women shouldn’t work, but work should never take priority over our kids.

When you’re on your deathbed, your boss and coworkers won’t be by your side—your family will. You won’t wish you had worked more; instead, your thoughts will be about your children.

If Erica’s message upsets you, ask yourself why. Is it because:

1. You’re denying a truth you already know deep down?
2. You feel frustrated that you haven't found a way to prioritize your children?
3. You feel trapped in your job and are looking for someone to blame?

It's a tough conversation, but one worth having. And remember: Its never too late to make a change. Your kids will grow; you reap what your sow.

I did not read all the comments here... but you clearly have something personal with her... What is she saying is quite true.. I know it hurts. She doesn't address you.. do you feel guilty?  Did you listen to the interview.. she 100% takes first the problem on the system, how the guvern and corporations don't give a chance to parents to raise healthy childrens. In the USA , the guvern doesn't do anything for the mother's.  And she talks about mothers to... if they can .. what they can do better.. She even said that it is better to have a neighbor or someone to stay with your child like an "" auntie "" than send it to daycare. .. how before mothers had family support in raising childrens, they always had around grandparents or another family She is even asked about the fact thatin USA like in all the countries, are people who will take the leave and still send the baby's to daycare and the mother's will lose time in mall. . And yes.. your child will suffer if you're sending it to daycare before 3 years.  If you look around, you will see  people who stayed home and those far away from family... they have problems. 
And for information, I don't care about your political views or hers . I am from Germany, and here I am in maternity leave..I had the opportunity to choose from one year to 2 years that are paid . In the option with more time you receive less money after 2 months from birth..in total you can stay home 3 years but the last year you don't receive any money but at least you have the health insurance and the rest paid. And in these 3 years you're employee cannot fire you. You must make some compromise how Erica said, but I get to stay 3 years with my baby at home. The same my mother and the previous generations did.. for them was easy because they had all these relatives close.. but as Erica said, we are far away from them and is hard. I was raised home.. grandparents, big sister.. my husband had to go to daycare after 1 year, solo mother,  new city, it was hard and tried her best...but yes, you could see it affected him... the way his relationships were. And the same others people that we know. If you know where to look and how you will see patterns .. and she is right again. You and everyone else should let this political nonsense aside and take from her what is best and apply to your life.

Yeah it’s weird, people in their 50s+ now wish they knew more about sun protection. People around mid 30s to late 40s are super strict with sun protection. People under 30 are under the belief you need extreme amounts of sun. 

People under 30 look older than those of us in our mid 30s and I’m going to assume lack of sun protection is why. 

The most worrying thing is from what I have seen, it’s the super fair people that are the worst with tanning. They refuse to embrace their fair features and want to be dark. As someone who was bullied in school for having darker features, this blows my mind.

Edit to add: a lot of young people are being influenced by hardcore vegan and carnivore based influencers who openly tell them not to use sunscreen. 

Just a PSA - you only need something like 15mins of no sunscreen at the very start of the day to get your vitamin D. Also, when people tell you not to use chemical based sunscreens, that’s fine, but at least use a zinc based one! We have the best formulations in the world here, there’s no reason to not use them.

Edit: user whereisthe711 did the usual thing that a lot of redditors do which is try to argue, then block you (me) before I can respond. I just want to make it clear, I am not trying to demonise Gen Z. The discussions we are having on here are, in general, to ensure younger generations who ARE more involved with social media to not just take what some influencer posts (regardless of the age of that influencer) and think it is fact. Speak to your GP and do your own research. There is a plethora of information out there that doesn’t need to be provided to you via tik tok.

My Dad was a surfer and fisherman all his life….i was born mid 60s….so the sun culture was at it peak in both our lifespans. My Dad was horrified by my dislike of laying in the sun, couldn’t understand me wanting to be in the shade, was embarrassed by my paleness I think. He called it unhealthy.

When he died last year from his 6th melanoma, this one they didn’t catch in time, one of our last conversations was Well, looks like you were right luv. I asked what on earth he was waffling about now? He said The sun, you were right about the sun……and just gave me an odd little smile. It wasn’t anything we had referred to in over 30 years.

Saddest bloody thing ever, because that man was so incredibly fit and healthy and active at 80 he should have lived to 100.

AustralianPolitics,young people and social media ban,David Pocock leaves the Climate 200 mothership,"In 2019, ACT Labor senator Katy Gallagher spent just $23,000 to ensure her re-election.

Gallagher, formerly the chief minister of a territory that habitually votes Labor at both levels of government, raised the money through cake stalls, raffles and small donations.

That all changed in 2022 when former Wallabies star David Pocock made a run for one of the two ACT Senate spots. Pocock did not adopt the teal branding of the community independents who wreaked havoc on the Liberal Party that year by taking six of its hitherto blue-ribbon lower house seats.

But, like them, he had the backing of Simon Holmes à Court’s progressive fundraising juggernaut Climate 200, which contributed $648,546 in cash and $207,836 in-kind support towards Pocock’s war chest of $1.7 million.

Because he and Gallagher – now the finance minister – were chasing the same progressive vote, Gallagher upped her campaign spend to about $200,000, of which half was spent on mailing every ACT resident a letter from Julia Gillard backing her. A report by The Canberra Times after the election said ACT Labor spent $1.24 million in total.

Gallagher won a full quota and kept her spot. Liberal incumbent Zed Seselja came second with 0.74 per cent of a quota, and Pocock was third with 0.64 per cent. Thanks to preferences from Greens and other independents, Pocock knocked off Seselja for the second spot, ending the last vestige of Liberal representation in the ACT.

In the territories, senators are elected every three years, and this year Pocock is lining up again – with one key difference. He has chosen to no longer receive backing from Climate 200, making him the first so-called teal to do so.

Pocock, who Labor believes will win a quota outright, will run a smaller campaign this time based on his record.

He believes Holmes à Court would be better off spending his money elsewhere – more so as this is the last time he can effectively buy seats before election spending is capped at $800,000 for individuals under changes passed by the major parties last year.

Climate 200 is backing candidates in 35 seats, including those already held by teals.

“Momentum for more genuine representation is growing and there is a new wave of community-backed independents who have a real shot at winning a seat at the next election,” Pocock told The Australian Financial Review in a statement.

“After the major parties’ stitch-up deal on electoral reform earlier this year, this will be the last election where new independent candidates can compete before the system is skewed even further to the advantage of major parties.”

But his decision to leave the Climate 200 mothership does come amid a rising sensitivity in the teal and community independent movement about Holmes à Court’s high public profile becoming a liability.

Speaking strictly on condition of anonymity, one teal insider said Holmes à Court was being increasingly likened to a “progressive Clive Palmer”. That is, every time he speaks publicly, be it at the National Press Club last week, or as part of a current tour of target electorates to promote the film No Safe Seat, it fuels the perception that “the candidates are the puppets of these billionaires”.

Unwarranted or not, perception matters in politics, especially at election time and especially when the Liberals and conservative proxy groups such as Advance are fighting back against the teals.

One community independent insider points to Holmes à Court’s confrontation with Liberal senator Jane Hume outside a polling booth in Kooyong before the last election. More recently, there have been revelations about a digital newspaper, Gazette News, which is funded by Climate 200 donors and targets the same seats as the group does.

The Coalition has referred it to the Australian Electoral Commission, claiming it is peddling misinformation.

“I don’t know a lot about Gazette,” Holmes à Court told the press club last week. “There’s no connection between Climate 200 and Gazette.

“I have met the founder of [Gazette, Anna Saulwick] before, I knew she was starting a business; [it] sounds like a really interesting development in media.”

Says the insider: “Every time he sticks his head up, it creates negative media. It shouldn’t be about him, it should be about the candidates.”

Another teal source said backing from Holmes à Court was a double-edged sword. His profile in raising the issue of climate change helped their cause, not to mention the money he raised, but him being in the limelight made them a target for campaigns and push polling alleging they were under his command.

The sensitivity is not a new thing. But it is growing.

Last year, the Financial Review’s independent power panel chose Holmes à Court for its annual covert power list because of the upheaval he had caused to the established order. Before publication, he and lower house teal Allegra Spender made representations to the newspaper under the misapprehension that he was chosen because he controlled the teal MPs. This was never cited as a reason by anyone on the judging panel.

While Pocock is now free to run his own race, those who know him say being detached from Climate 200 is a bonus even if he has fewer resources at his disposal.

Meanwhile, Gallagher, who rebranded her campaign as “Team Katy”, is scratching around for the $500,000 she estimates she’ll need this time. Which is not easy in a city where the only people with money are property developers, and they are banned from political donations.

For the finance minister, it’s a long way from the lamington drives of 2019.",146,149,nobelharvards,https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/david-pocock-leaves-the-climate-200-mothership-20250318-p5lkch,2025-03-20 22:21:17,"**Greetings humans.**

You don't nuke an email addy you've had that long, not now. You start by changing the password on it and enabling 2FA and using a random password from your newly installed password manager (Bitwarden recommended) and then start going through shit. 

Get a privacy respecting email provider, I'd recommend Proton, Tuta is OK as well, but more barebones.

That way you'll still get them, but don't have to worry about them having your actual email address.

Once you've been working at this for a while, and your old email address traffic has calmed down, then forward it to your newer email address so you don't lose anything you've forgotten about, which you 100% will. As you see things being forwarded, it'll remind you to update them, or get rid of them completely.

Note: If you go with Proton, and do the premium version (couple bucks a month, deals on Black Friday as well) then it gets upgraded to basically a full blown email client will all the bells and whistles, ok, not ALL, but most.

AustralianPolitics,young people and social media ban,Australian election 2025: Evidence suggests Coalition not ready to lead,"**Shaun Carney, Columnist, April 10, 2025 — 5.00am**

It’s just three days since Peter Dutton made one of the most humiliating campaign U-turns I’ve seen in more than 40 years of covering federal elections, and in these fast-moving times, it’s already almost out of range in the rearview mirror.

Dutton and his campaign people would, understandably, like us all to move on from his decision to drop the policy to end working from home for federal public servants.

It’s a bit too soon for that. Let’s stop the clock for a moment and try to understand what happened in this bizarre episode. The motivation isn’t to exploit the opposition leader’s discomfort; it’s to take a look at how the alternative government has been going about its business on the way to the election.

The crunch on working from home was accompanied by a pledge to get 41,000 public servants off the books pronto. It was robust, assertive stuff that was warmly embraced by the Coalition’s media friends, protectors and boosters. But Dutton [confessed on Monday](https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/the-moment-peter-dutton-knew-his-work-from-home-plan-was-dead-20250407-p5lpp3.html) when interring the policy that it had been a blunder. “We’ve made a mistake with the policy. We apologise for that. And we’ve dealt with it,” he told a television interviewer.

What was the mistake? Either you believe in a policy because it’s right for the country or you don’t. In this case, the policy lasted a mere five weeks. It was an economic and workplace relations policy, announced by the finance spokeswoman, Jane Hume, in a speech delivered at the Menzies Research Institute in early March. The title of the speech was “A Lack of Respect Leads to Waste”. Hume went in hard on working from home in the federal public service – how wasteful and occasionally ridiculous it was.

“In one instance, a stakeholder travelled to Canberra only to be shown into a meeting room where they were greeted by all departmental participants dialling in from home,” she said. “One public servant told my office that one of their colleagues worked from home five days a week. They were frequently uncontactable and thus unreliable. Why? Because while they were working, they were also travelling around Australia with their family in a campervan.”

It was clear in Hume’s speech and in a subsequent Q&A session that the Liberals were sceptical of working from home beyond just the federal public service. She said it was harmful for productivity across many workplaces and praised big Australian companies including Coles, Flight Centre and the Commonwealth and National Australia banks for telling their employees to return to the office. This was all supposedly argued from a point of conviction and yet it’s now dead. The 41,000 surplus public servants it was vital to get rid of would now gradually leave and not be replaced.

Turns out the “mistake” was political because that’s where the policy came from: a political calculation. The Coalition wrongly believed it would be popular to act like the big, tough boss and single out public servants as lazy good-for-nothings – basically pitting one group of Australians against others, which sadly is often part of Dutton’s MO.

Did his nuclear energy idea not come from a similar divisive source, offering comfort to climate change deniers against believers? The same goes for foreign students and migrants who are, we are told, robbing young Aussies of the chance to buy property.

Dutton blamed a Labor “scare campaign” for the reversal, which is not convincing. More likely, this was another WorkChoices: a policy that looked like an inequitable stinker to too many workers. Voters working in the private sector knew Dutton couldn’t force them back to the office. But they saw it as an anti-worker policy tied in with the intention to sack Commonwealth employees in big numbers that could send a green light to their own bosses.

In politics, if you make decisions for the wrong reasons, bad luck tends to follow you around. The Coalition’s economic policy team is not in good order. Hume has suffered a series of humiliations. Not only is she taking the hit over the working-from-home fiasco, but she has to share her role with Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, appointed to a newly created portfolio of government efficiency days after Donald Trump was sworn in, just as Elon Musk and his little bunch of tech nerds were getting to work with DOGE.

Price, the great retail-politician find of the Voice referendum campaign, was expected to take a larger role in this campaign, but comparisons with the malodorous Musk and Trump have led to a rethink. Meanwhile, shadow treasurer Angus Taylor continues on, to little effect so far. All this in a cost-of-living election.

Anthony Albanese is dismissed by opposition supporters as “Each-Way Albo”. Is Dutton all that different? Trump is a serious problem for him. When Trump said he wanted to turn Gaza into a holiday resort without Palestinians, Dutton described him as “a big thinker” and “shrewd”. At Tuesday night’s debate with Albanese, in reply to a question about dealing with Trump, he said that as prime minister he would have what it takes to stand up to the “bullies” who “seek to do us harm”.

All too often as the election approaches, it’s difficult not to look at what the opposition is doing and wonder if the leader and his brains trust really believe that this is the way to demonstrate they’re ready for office. The biggest objective of any opposition, especially one in its first term away from the Treasury benches, is to show that it’s more skilful and professional than the mob in charge – that it regards formulating a full, soundly tested policy agenda as its most important task.

Sure, tenderising your opponents with vigorous critiques is satisfying. It can alert voters to the indelible shortcomings of the other crowd. But as Dutton is finding out, it ultimately makes for empty calories. An opposition has to show that it’s better. Forming a policy that’s apparently central to your principles and budget costings and then abandoning it in little more than a month inevitably leads to the question: is that how you plan to govern?",145,29,Enthingification,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/is-the-coalition-ready-to-lead-australia-all-evidence-suggests-not-20250408-p5lq76.html,2025-04-10 06:45:58,"**Greetings humans.**

It's a great point on Jacinta Price.

She was EVERYWHERE back in January and February. But since she was put onto the role of ""Government Efficiency"" which is so heavily linked with Musk, Trump and policies that the Liberals have now outright abandoned, as well as wanting to put abortion ""back on the national agenda"", it seems that she has been almost entirely removed from the campaign.

Remarkable, considering that before that, she was seen as the most popular LNP member in the country according to polling. 

A genuine own goal and shows just how quickly you can undo your political capital.

The Coalition have been remarkably united during the term. It is all starting to unravel now.

I reckon their unity reflected the fact that there was not serious policy debate (and therefore division) and the lack of internal testing and substance is showing.

I don't think they've been trying to come up with solutions to problems in any way, shape or form. They've been hoping that they'd govern by default by not being Albo.

AustralianPolitics,social media age restriction Australia,"Not climate or housing  – no, our moral outrage is saved for taxing the rich","With everything happening in the world, it is probably easy to miss what is apparently becoming one of the Greatest Issues Of Our Time.

It’s not addressing the housing affordability crisis, which has shown that rental stress is at record highs, social housing doesn’t come close to meeting demand, and safe and affordable housing is becoming a luxury.

It’s not raising the rate or ending mutual obligations or ensuring that we actually do lift people out of poverty, a test we carried out during the pandemic and proved we can achieve quite simply, if there is the will.

And it’s not only climate, which is about to get another kick in the guts domestically with Labor to approve the 50-year expansion of Woodside’s North West Shelf project – which will add the equivalent of a dozen coal-fired power stations of emissions to the atmosphere, increase domestic costs for Western Australians and further erode priceless rock art that survived an ice age.

It’s not even Australia’s continued absenteeism in responding to Israel’s genocide in Gaza.

No, it’s none of those. It’s even bigger.

Are you ready?

It’s … very rich people being asked to pay a tiny bit of tax on a small percentage of the earnings on their wealth.

Yup. Labor’s very modest super changes. Which it announced in the last term of parliament but said it wouldn’t move on until this term, to give the 80,000 or so people this will impact time to get used to paying a tiny bit of extra tax. (Or receiving a lower tax break, depending on how you look at things.)

>[ ](https://twitter.com/KosSamaras/status/1925381876430381358)

It’s a whopping 0.5 per cent of the population we are talking about here.

According to the tax office, the average income of someone with $3 million in their super is $381,000. If you have more than $5 million in superannuation, your average income is about $495,000. And if you are one of the handful with more than $20 million in your super, your average income is just short of $1.3 million.

We’re not exactly talking Jan and Joe Average here.

Oh, but maybe one day you COULD have $3 million in your super and then you too will be subjected to having to pay a tiny bit of tax on earnings above that $3 million balance. Not the balance itself – just the earnings on the capital above $3 million.

Let’s say that COULD be you, or your children. And yes, sure, one day in 20 or 30 years, it COULD impact more people.



Putting aside the fact that no one seems to care how any other policy is going to impact future generations in two or three decades, let’s meet Prudence. Unlike most 18 year olds, Prudence is very worried about her superannuation balance and has spent a lot of time reading Tim Wilson’s socials, so Prudence is heading into the labour market ready to do battle.

For Prudence to retire with $3 million, she has to earn at least $150,000 a year right off the bat. Then she needs to secure at least a 3.7 per cent annual pay rise. And no time off, Prudence! No unpaid leave time for you!

If she does all of that, she will retire with just over $3 million in her super account. Thoughts and prayers for Prudence then (assuming that the same legislation has remained in place and untouched for her entire working life), for she will receive a slightly lower tax break (or a slightly higher tax applied, again depending on how you look at it) on the earnings above her $3 million balance.

That’s a huge amount to take in. Better not do anything then, because poor Prudence!



Some of the criticisms have been truly ridiculous. It’s not going to impact investment, or the start-up sector, or even farmers (someone would have put their farm into their superannuation only to pay less tax. It is not the responsibility of the Australian people to keep subsidising wealthy people’s assets).

What it is going to do, is tax the rich. Just a tiny, tiny, tiny bit more.  
It’s a slightly lower tax concession for people who have more money than you could ever need to retire, who want to maintain their tax breaks.

We know that self-managed super funds are popular as tax avoidance mechanisms and estate planning vehicles. These very small changes are just addressing some of the vast imbalances in wealth in this country, where rich people can move assets and wealth into whatever provides them with the best tax break, abusing systems built to ensure a fair retirement, not non-stop wealth accumulation.

And the rich people are very annoyed at being asked to pay a tiny bit more tax than they planned to. Finance professor Mark Humphery-Jenner told the *Australian Financial Review* that it was “moral repugnance \[to target\] someone merely because they are wealthy”.

But the fact is, it is morally repugnant to NOT tax the rich. Especially now.

A recent ANU study found that the pre-tax income of Australians aged over 60 was equal to the average mid-career income of 65 per cent of the working population (and much higher than most workers aged between 18 and 30).

That’s been fuelled by government policy in the past couple of decades, which has led to older generations earning significantly more private income “primarily as a result of higher capital income from real estate and superannuation”.

Put simply, previous generations have enjoyed tax breaks and policies that have helped them amass wealth younger generations can only dream of. And now people are complaining they might receive a slightly lower tax concession on part of that wealth.

Apparently we all need to be very worried about budget deficits and the need for structural reform – but only if modestly addressing it doesn’t make rich people upset.

It’s very telling that the critics of this modest policy have used farmers as the poster group for who might be harmed. That’s because they know if they showed you someone in Double Bay or Cottesloe (where the median incomes are $428,489 and $365,588) no one would care. And rightly so.

The legislation will be Labor’s first big test in the new parliament. Not because it’s bad policy, but because it upsets people who are not used to being the target of government cuts.

A [wealth tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_tax) is what's required if you want to address a wealth gap.    

Most people imagine the wealth gap in Australia think it's fairly even - but in actual fact, the [richest 5th of the population - own TWO THIRDS of all the wealth!](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jul/31/richest-20-per-cent-of-households-own-62-per-cent-of-all-wealth-says-new-report)   

This is no longer a proportional issue - we're talking about an EXPONENTIAL imbalance. What's more the wealthiest, tend to be the best at escaping taxes, because they can pay people to find all the loop holes, and do all the lobbying (there's in fact [a whole industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_defense_industry) dedicated to it).     
  
Any exponential issue is going to get much worse in terms of the class divide, and the lack of unity in the country's values. We'll see a greater and greater disparity between the wealthiest and poorest, a greater manipulation of power, and that has a snowballing effect. If unaddressed, or encouraged it will eventually lead to a less and less stable Australia.      

This should be a primary concern for anyone who wants a good quality of living, or to be free from street crime, or to be free from the corruption, privatisation, and destruction of our public services and assets.

AustralianPolitics,social media age restriction Australia,Election 2025: Peter Dutton vows to keep electric vehicle tax break he opposed,"Michael Read

Peter Dutton has pledged to keep a tax break for electric vehicles that has blown out tenfold in cost and which the opposition earlier dismissed as bad policy, as the major parties abandon budget repair in the countdown to the election.

The Australian Financial Review revealed in March that Labor’s signature measure to encourage EV uptake had blown out massively, with taxpayers spending $560 million a year to exempt one in three EV drivers from paying fringe benefits tax.

The tax break is available when a person buys an EV worth less than $91,387 through a novated lease, where an employer pays a car lease through pre-tax salary deductions.

The FBT exemption, which the Coalition voted against in parliament, can save a vehicle owner tens of thousands of dollars over several years and has been far more popular than Treasury forecast.

The Financial Review’s report prompted opposition infrastructure spokeswoman Bridget McKenzie to post on social media: “What has to be cut from the federal budget to pay for Labor’s pursuit of an EV-only future?”

But the opposition has decided not to scrap the measure it voted against, and which shadow treasurer Angus Taylor in March labelled “bad policy dressed up as tax reform”.

Asked on Monday whether the government would repeal the tax break, Dutton said “we don’t have any proposals to change those settings”.

“I want people to have choice. If people want to buy an EV, that’s fantastic. If they want to buy a Ford Ranger or a Toyota HiLux, or whatever it might be, that’s a choice they should have,” he told reporters in Melbourne.

The Coalition has had a rocky relationship with electric vehicles. In 2019, then-prime minister Scott Morrison famously accused Bill Shorten of wanting to “end the weekend” when he set a target for 50 per cent of all new car sales to be electric by 2030.

AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said the election campaign was not going well for anyone hoping for rational economic policies designed to strengthen the economy.

“The billions of dollars in spending promises from both sides of politics will add to Australia’s projected decade or more of budget deficits and rising public debt,” Oliver said.

The Productivity Commission said in its five-yearly inquiry in 2023 that the FBT exemption for EVs was one of the most ineffective ways to reduce vehicle emissions, with an implied cost of $987 to $20,084 a tonne.

The cost to taxpayers dwarfs the carbon price paid by heavy emitters of less than $40 a tonne via Australian carbon credit units (ACCUs) and the $75 carbon price cap the government has imposed for the carbon safeguard mechanism.

The PC also warned the FBT exemption was inequitable, because richer households were disproportionately more likely to purchase EVs, and risked undermining the integrity of the income tax system.

Treasury originally forecast the FBT exemption would cost just $55 million in 2024-25. Labor says the tax break is vital to boosting electric vehicle adoption rates and achieving its target to reduce emissions by 43 per cent on 2005 levels by the end of the decade.

But Treasury appears to have dramatically underestimated the lure of the generous tax break, with independent analysis by the Institute of Public Accountants finding the exemption could now cost the government $564 million a year in forgone revenue.

Electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids accounted for about 10 per cent of all new car sales last year. Under the FBT exemption policy, a person who leases a $60,000 car would save close to $12,000 a year if they bought an EV instead of a petrol car through a novated lease.

Labor was forced to carve plug-in hybrids out of the policy after three years to secure support from Senate crossbenchers, who argued they were “legacy fossil fuel technologies”. The scheme is scheduled to be reviewed in the middle of this year.",139,61,patslogcabindigest,https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/dutton-vows-to-keep-ev-tax-break-he-opposed-20250421-p5lt6w,2025-04-22 01:12:03,"**Greetings humans.**

I doubt that the pro-fossil fuel message has escaped voters' attention, particularly in independent seats.

At what point, after all this backflipping on policy, do you realise that nobody is buying what you're selling?

This EV policy is a success, and a much bigger success than expected.

> Peter Dutton has pledged to keep a tax break for electric vehicles that has blown out tenfold in cost and which the opposition earlier dismissed as bad policy, as the major parties abandon budget repair in the countdown to the election.

Leasing an EV is 10 times more popular than it was expected to be.  

And

A concession for leasing an EV has put 10 times as many EVs on the road as expected.

If we are going to reduce the cost to the budget of salary packaging vehicles, why not start with ICEs?  There are still concessions there.

The economy is weaker on a dead planet.  Fossil fuels are changing the climate.

> AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said the election campaign was not going well for anyone hoping for rational economic policies designed to strengthen the economy.

The economy is stronger if we produce more of what is needed.  EVs use domestically produced electricity, and ICEs use imported fossil fuels.

> “The billions of dollars in spending promises from both sides of politics will add to Australia’s projected decade or more of budget deficits and rising public debt,” Oliver said.

Australia's public debt was too small.  Increases in debt and deficits over COVID are part of the policy mix that lowered unemployment from 5-6%, where it had been stuck for a decade, to the current much lower levels.

Where is the concern for Australia's private debt, which is larger, much too large, and, unlike public debt, can more easily create problems?

AustralianPolitics,Albanese social media ban,Exclusive: David Pocock’s demands of a minority government,"David Pocock wants a far greater slice of Australian gas export income through the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, and the reform of capital gains and negative gearing tax breaks. These are the crossbencher’s two top demands for whichever party seeks to form government after the election, as part of his broader integrity agenda in the 48th parliament.

The independent ACT senator has cast off Climate 200 support in 2025 as he again vies with Labor’s Katy Gallagher, as well as a low-profile Liberal challenger who is seeking Canberra’s “contractor vote”. On this issue, Pocock is leaning confidently into the federal Coalition’s Trump-style attacks on the public service.

“Every day is a minority government in the Senate. I’ll work with whoever is in there, but I won’t tolerate the kind of Canberra-bashing we have seen and a plan that will decimate the Canberra economy, the ACT economy,” Pocock tells *The Saturday Paper*.

“The thing that people need to understand, and I think are starting to realise, that when you say, ‘We’re going to cut 41,000 public servants’ – even if not all of them are from Canberra, if a big chunk of them are from Canberra – that’s a huge impact on small businesses in the ACT.

“You can’t just remove public servants and not have an impact on other sectors of the ACT economy.”

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b9S2JL-XZY&ab\_channel=TheSaturdayPaper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b9S2JL-XZY&ab_channel=TheSaturdayPaper)

The former Wallabies captain is seeking a second term as an ACT representative after his election in 2022 – territory senators face voters every three years instead of the usual six. With current voting trends, neither Labor nor the Coalition is expected to secure a majority in the Senate at this election.

Both Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton have ruled out cutting deals with the Greens should they need to form minority government.

Pocock sees the possibility of a hung parliament, predicted in most major opinion polls, as a way to deliver reform to address debt reduction, the environment and housing challenges.

He nominates the resource rent tax and housing tax reform as the “low-hanging fruit” of the next parliament.

“Both major parties jump up and down about budget deficits, structural reform and then do exactly nothing to actually change things when it comes to revenue and structural reform. Why would we give away half of our gas for free? Export LNG has brought in zero cents of Petroleum Resource Rent Tax. Ridiculous.”

To tackle the housing affordability crisis, Pocock wants housing treated as a human right and “more courage” from the major parties. He is not pursuing the sweeping agenda of the Greens, however.

“We have to look at the capital gains tax and negative gearing,” Pocock says. “I don’t think it’s a case of you either leave it as it is or you just scrap everything.”

With the Coalition having largely opposed key government legislation in the last parliament, Labor required support in the Senate from the Greens and crossbenchers such as Pocock, Jacqui Lambie and Lidia Thorpe. Key housing legislation was held up for months by the Greens, who are also eyeing the balance of power in a possible minority government. They want the capital gains tax discount and negative gearing scrapped but are offering exemptions for people with one investment property.

“Senator Jacqui Lambie and I had a range of measures costed,” Pocock says. “I think in that there’s some really sensible ways to turn it around, including by grandfathering existing arrangements. People have made investments based on the current rules. You may not like the rules, but they have been the rules.”

It will be no simple negotiation if Labor is on the other side of it. Labor took these two property tax reform proposals to the 2019 election – a platform that some blame for former party leader Bill Shorten’s defeat.

Albanese has repeatedly rejected any wind-back of tax breaks for investment properties, particularly in relation to housing policies from the Greens.

Out on the campaign trail, the prime minister was asked bluntly, “Can you rule out any changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax settings if re-elected?” Albanese responded tersely, “Yes. How hard is it? For the 50th time.”

Treasurer Jim Chalmers has also scoffed, saying, “We’ve got our own agenda on housing.”

Pocock also wants to steer the major parties onto matters of integrity. Like independent MP Helen Haines and the Greens, he says the National Anti-Corruption Commission ought to be subject to an expedited statutory review and to have far more open hearings. He also wants gambling reform pursued in the next term, in line with the wishes of late Labor MP Peta Murphy: a total ban on gambling ads.

“I’m constantly pushing senior public servants to do better,” Pocock says. “Yes, we should have high expectations. We should be spending money well. The way to do that is to actually fully fund something like the Australian National Audit Office, which the Coalition severely underfunded and Labor haven’t fully funded.

“They still can’t do as many audits as they’d like. That’s a real indictment on both of them. That should be your starting point. And then let’s start to look at things like procurement.”

Liberal sources tell *The Saturday Paper* that Pocock could have bargained harder with Labor in his first term to clinch concession, particularly for the ACT.

In the territory race, Pocock’s main rival is Labor’s first pick Katy Gallagher, a former ACT chief minister who in her subsequent federal ministerial career has become the most powerful politician Canberra has ever produced. She, too, is heavily focused on the Liberals’ attacks on the bureaucracy.

“Pocock has made it clear he’d work with anyone. That’s the position he’s taken as an independent,” the minister tells *The Saturday Paper*.

“A Liberal government would decimate this city regardless of whether Senator Pocock is on the cross bench. They’ve basically declared war on our town. They’ve disrespected us. They disrespect the work that we do, all the roles that we play in the nation.

“The only way to stop that is to stop \[Dutton\] being elected. And the only way to do that is to vote Labor. It’s pretty clear. That’s very clear in my head.”

Despite being seen as a Labor town with the party holding all three lower house seats and Gallagher’s Senate seat, there is a solid block of Liberal voters in Canberra, and she regards the three-way tussle with Pocock as making the ACT marginal and challenging.

In 2022, Gallagher’s campaign shifted to a defensive “Keep Katy” mode as it became apparent the Labor vote was under threat from either strategic voting or complacency from traditional voters.

Pocock ended up defeating conservative Liberal minister Zed Seselja for one of the ACT’s two Senate seats, but the numbers showed that while he peeled off disaffected Liberal voters, he was more successful in carving off progressive votes from Labor and the Greens.

Gallagher expects Pocock to beat her to fill the seat quota in his second-term quest.

“I do think Pocock is very popular, and I think there’s a level of complacency about support for me in the sense that a lot of people say, ‘Oh, Katy’s elected,’ ” she says, also referring to a “rusted on” Liberal vote in the ACT of about 25 per cent.

The Liberal Senate candidate Jacob Vadakkedathu – the owner of a small consultancy company – had to campaign in the context of his party’s policy to slash the public service by 41,000 positions. This is the total roles added since Labor took power and switched capacity away from expensive consultants. The Coalition’s stated focus on Canberra for the cuts would have meant laying waste to 60 per cent of bureaucrats based in the capital.  The backtrack announced this week by Peter Dutton means the proposed cuts would be achieved only by a hiring freeze and natural attrition.

At the same time, he also abandoned the policy to force public servants back to the office. Local Liberals say they had sway. “It’s a big win for us that we got the change. Don’t think these things happen without conversations,” a party source tells *The Saturday Paper*.

Requests from this paper for an interview with Vadakkedathu did not receive a response.

The Liberal candidate has been media shy throughout the campaign, but he gave an early interview to ABC Radio in which he backed Dutton’s planned cuts to the Canberra bureaucracy. He also defended the Liberal leader’s decision, should he become prime minister, to take up residence in Sydney’s Kirribilli House instead of the Lodge in Canberra, saying the comment was “taken out of context”.

The Liberals reject any notion they have given up in the ACT, saying they are running a “very traditional, finance-based, cost-of-living campaign for the average Canberra family”.

The party sees a significant opportunity in the number of Canberrans who have had to leave lucrative government contract positions and may want to blame Labor at the ballot box.

“There is a cohort of people who much prefer to work as contractors and their lives have been severely curtailed under Katy’s leadership in the Senate,” the Liberal source tells *The Saturday Paper*.

“We meet them over and over again. We have them in the party. We meet them on the hustings. They loved their life as contractors. It just doesn’t suit the Labor narrative, you see. They were paid more. They took more risk. Now some of them are employees of departments because they are still needed to do work. They would prefer to go back to being contractors if it was stable and reasonable.”

Gallagher says contractors were often asked to do roles of public servants, not the more specialised roles they wanted to do. “They’re consultants or contractors for a reason,” she says.

In his ACT campaign, Pocock says he will keep pressing for a “city deal” to attract more investment to the national capital – a Coalition-era initiative that Labor has not been keen to revive. Pocock has used his position to extract local benefits, such as helping to restore ACT access to assisted dying, an Upper Murrumbidgee River package and cancer support for ACT firefighters.

If Labor and the Liberals are serious about public service efficiency, says David Pocock, then there should be better funding for established independent mechanisms to improve it.

On the issue of campaign funding, the independent senator had a $1.79 million “war chest” in 2022 and just over $850,000 came from the political fundraising vehicle Climate 200. There was also a number of large donations from wealthy investors and many small individual donations.

Pocock says he’s passed up Climate 200 funding in 2025, and he’s never wanted to be seen as a “teal” independent in the Senate.

At the halfway point of the campaign, he is running on half the amount of donations that came in over the full 2022 race.

“I didn’t feel like I needed the money. I think they’re \[Climate 200\] really useful and important for new campaigns, but as an incumbent you have all the incumbency advantages,” the senator says. “You’ve got a team, you more or less know what you’re doing, and I want to stand on my record and back myself to be able to raise money based on what I’ve done.

“And I think we’ve seen that. People are keen to support community-backed independents that are in there fighting for them.

“We’ve had way more smaller donations. So, it will come out with declarations, and we can sit and compare and contrast.”

Asked by *The Saturday Paper* if the large individual donations of the last campaign are happening again, he said: “I think there’s been a few, not to the same scale as last time.

“This time, I’ve had over a thousand people contribute to my campaign. It’s far, far leaner.”

With minority government in the Senate set to be returned on May 3, there have so far been no overtures from either of the major parties. Pocock knows he is a competitor.

AustralianPolitics,age verification social media Australia,Dutton’s podcast debut was a ratings flop,"Article:
Peter Dutton’s interview with Australian diver Sam Fricker bombed on YouTube, receiving only 4600 views despite the Olympian’s 5.8 million subscribers, showing the pitfalls for politicians trying to use alternative media to reach voters.

Fricker released the hour-long interview in December that covered soft topics including Dutton’s childhood, family life and career before entering politics, as part of the opposition leader’s drive to reshape his image as a political hardman as Australia heads into federal election season.

But the interview reached just 0.08 per cent of Fricker’s subscriber base on YouTube, a platform that was key to Donald Trump’s success in reaching disengaged voters, whereas breakfast television programs such as Seven’s Sunrise or Nine’s Today reach average audiences of between 300,000 and 400,000 people.

Social media and marketing consultants said the decision to conduct a long interview with an online personality such as Fricker risked reaching a limited audience.

“Typically if someone has a million subscribers, the engagement rate would be at minimum 25 per cent, so on average you would expect an average of 100,000 views per video as a minimum,” social media manager and founder of Wize agency Jack Campbell said. “If I was a politician, I would be doing my due diligence to ensure that whoever I am engaging with has legitimate followers because it could hurt them more if the interviewer has little engagement.”

Both parties are increasing their social media presence to try to win over voters who do not consume mainstream media reporting, ahead of an election that polls project will be tight.

Dutton showcased his softer persona in January with an Instagram video giving a message of unity and getting Australia back on track.


On Sunday, he and his wife Kirilly Dutton gave an interview to 60 Minutes, with his family rejecting the public perception of the Coalition leader as lacking empathy.

Earlier in February, the opposition leader revealed to former Liberal staffer Peta Credlin on Sky News that he had his first daughter with his then-fiancee, but the relationship ended while she was pregnant. He has largely avoided tougher interview settings, although he has appeared on the ABC’s 7.30, and until this year’s sitting weeks had done only a handful of press conferences in Canberra.

Marketing strategist Toby Ralph, who has worked 40 elections around the world, including former prime minister John Howard’s campaigns, said political campaigns have to navigate the risks of spending time on social media’s many niche audiences.

“[When an] interview with a would-be prime minister only draws a few hundred eyeballs, something’s awry,” he said.

There is no suggestion Fricker has manipulated his subscriber count, only that his videos have not drawn the engagement politicians are used to through mainstream media.

Fricker’s 5.87 million YouTube subscriber count is higher than Sky News’ 5.32 million, Nine News’ 1.56 million or even prominent American YouTubers such as comedian Theo Von (3.68 million) or astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson’s show, which has 4.31 million. Nine is the owner of this masthead.

In a brief statement, Dutton backed Fricker. “[Environment minister] Tanya Plibersek and I don’t agree on much, but we’ve both been on his podcast and I’m sure, like me, she believes Sam is a great and inspirational young Australian,” Dutton said.

Plibersek’s interview with Fricker received about 800 views. Former prime minister Scott Morrison’s interview generated about 1000.

The YouTuber’s highest rating video has 87,000 views, while his highest-rating short – similar to a TikTok video or Instagram reel, which is a quick video – has 500 million views.

But those views do not represent the total impact of a podcast interview, which listeners can find via clips or replayed in its entirety on other platforms including Spotify and Instagram. Unlike YouTube, some of those services do not disclose listener figures, making it hard to gauge the reach of a podcast’s audience.

Plibersek declined to comment. Fricker did not respond to requests for comment.

Former Labor Party strategist Megan Lane said Dutton’s tactic would probably be to lay the groundwork for what narrative he wants to send to voters, and argued the low number of views makes it low-risk.

“Layering has always been a key to successful political communications; you have to say it over and over and over again in lots of different places in the hope that someone sees it once, with the dream that someone sees it three times and it sticks,” she said.

The problem is that I've become ugly due to an Illness breaking down the collagen and elastin in my skin. I try to disguise it as much as I can by wearing false eyelashes and hair extensions except the problem is that they look weird on my deformed face and I look like a clown.
My options are ugly, or clown. So I go to clown because feeling ugly causes me even more depression.

But the problem is people see this clown and give looks which really hurt me, make me feel ashamed, and make me feel like not going anywhere in public.

A friend who suffered sever facial burns during a cosmetic procedure (acid peel) had this problem. Make up to disguise the scars looked, well, clownish and demonstrably fake.

She decided to own the scars and present without the ""disguise"" and people just accepted her for who she was without judgement for the most part.

this is going to sound harsh but when faced with the choice between ugly and clown, ugly is actually the better choice. tonnes of people are ugly. no one is going to take a second glance at an ugly person. but you don't see people looking clownish as often and people might look for longer without even thinking about it as they try to figure out why someone looks a little off. 

fwiw, i agree with others that you are your own worst critic and will be hyper aware of people looking at you in a way that you weren't before such that you'll think people are looking and judging you more than they are. most people don't give a damn what others look like as they're going about their day (most of us are too worried about ourselves to spend much time focusing on others!)

I felt compelled to respond again, as it was on my mind over lunch.

For what it’s worth, I have never once looked at someone walking down the street and thought “gee, that’s an ugly person.” 

I have only ever had those thoughts once I’ve gotten to know someone. Gee, that’s an ugly person. Cliche as it is, ugliness really does come from within.

I almost aways see something intriguing and magnetic about someone’s face, even those who might not consider themselves classically good looking.

I *have* looked at someone’s face before and wondering if there was a story, or an underlying medical issue responsible for their appearance. In these cases, I’d like to think I looked with good intention and genuine curiosity.

We’re all human, all navigating the same world in these flesh sacks we’ve been given. Some are missing limbs, others burnt or scarred, and plenty are riddled with cancer. ALL of us, if lucky enough, will succumb to old age. It won’t be pretty.

There will be assholes who stare or judge you, and it will hurt. But I guarantee you those people will be  boring, petty, unworthy people. Not worth knowing and definitely not worth considering their opinion.

If we wait 5 years and see how they are going, might be a much easier pickup if it's intended to firm renewables than a full sized nuclear plant that's going to take 15 (no way it's 10 lol) years to build.
But it's important what while we are doing all that stuff, we keep pushing ahead with big investments in renewables, and specifically storage.
Feels like we get the best of both worlds there. Of course because this whole stupid thing is crazy political, no way Labor goes for that, and Dutton has already said he is going to reduce renewables investments. So we will end up with a shit option either way. Happy to hear thoughts on the edit too lol.


Original Post

I am trying to have a genuine conversation here please guys, and would appreciate it if we could keep it polite and factual. I have gotten into too many arugments with people and had fractured information thrown about in a bunch of different posts.

I am not a nuclear engineer, nuclear scientist, or energy specialist. As such, i have to trust the experts who are providing reports (as should all of you). I will be up front in saying that because of this, I am firmly behind renewables but am completely open to be swayed if someone can provide me with some data sourced analysis by an expert in the field.  
And if im struggling to parse it and you are an engineer. Break that badboy down for the rest of us.

So far, the only official reports ive seen are:

CSIRO Gencost Report

[https://www.csiro.au/en/research/technology-space/energy/gencost](https://www.csiro.au/en/research/technology-space/energy/gencost)

AEMO (Australian Energy Markert Operators) Integrated System Plan

[https://aemo.com.au/en/energy-systems/major-publications/integrated-system-plan-isp](https://aemo.com.au/en/energy-systems/major-publications/integrated-system-plan-isp)

  
IPCC Mitigation of Climage Change 

Someone who was claiming to be an engineer that worked on this report was tyring to tell me it proved the CSIRO Gencost report wrong and that they all laughed about the report together. When i read it, i cant find anything but reccomendations to proceed with renewables. When i asked for a specific page to read i got told ""The data is easy to find, im not doing your research for you.

[https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-3/](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-3/)

  
I did have someone point me to a 5 page document written by the director of an SMR startup saying that gencost report was bad, and the solution is SMRs (which to my knowledge are not commercially viable, and the only 2 working ones are in China and Russia). I was happy to read that paper, but it provided no numbers, no sources, just vague theories and a reccomendation for the product he was selling.

Ok, so id like to do this in 2 parts.

**Firstly, which is the better solution for australia to provide energy. Nuclear or Renewables?**

1. Looking at the three reports above, its renewables and its not close.  
2. We already have the expertise.  
3. We already have the integration.  
4. It allows for incremental improvement over the next 15-20 years instead of one big jump  
5. It costs less to run per mwh than nuclear does once both are built.  
6. The AEMO have laid out a step by step plan to increase storage, reduce coal, and use natural gas as a backup while we build up enough storage redundency and implemet other backups like renewable biofuel or green hydrogen. They have explained the plan for a distribued grid and are assuming power usage will double by 2050.  
7. According to the gencost report, solar and wind with firming is still by far the cheapers, and quickest option for us to build.  
8. Firming would initially be done with gas(as per the AEMO plan) and we would look to eventually firm using things like thermal storage (CSP is finally cost competative with fossil fuels according to the IPCC report) and something like green hydrogen, ie use the massively available and cheap solar power to create and store green hydrogen.



I have seen people saying that the the gencost report or the AEMO plan havent taken into account ""x"" or ""y"" cost. Ok then, please show me what they have missed. Give me something i can read that shows me what they have done wrong. Because it would be insane of me to take the assurances of someone online claiming they are a nuclear engineer and trust them. It would be insane of anyone to take the claims of any political party or prominent person without them providing something that gives us some data to counter the things that the official reports say.  
CSRIO SUCKS or AEMO ARE DUMB isnt a counter guys. ""I talked to a guy from CSIRO and he was a moron"" doesnt help anything. It just inflames the conversation without actually providing any reliable information.

  
So please, can i have someone who knows what they are talking about explain what the problems with the three reports above are, and where i can find alternate or supporting data to improve my understanding of it.

My biggest concern is that going for nuclear will mean that we dont have any changes to emissions and bills get more expensive for the nexy 15-20 years.

I say 15-20 years because there is no way we can remove the ban, put together reulations and legislation, set up a supply chain, get the right expertise and build a nuclear plant in 10 years.   
France, one of the best nuclear countries around. The only plant currently under construction there is now in year 17 of the project. It was planned as an 8 year project. And these guys have decades or experience, laws in place, supply chains ready.  
Argentian building nuclear plant number 4 are 10 years and counting into 4 year build of a small 25MW plant.  
The USA announced this massive project for SMRs to be used commercially for the first time in 2014.  IT was cancelled with no results in 2023, with cost and time blowouts.

So i would really like to know if theres anything i can look at that will give me a bit of confidence the 2035 date is a real thing. More than anything else above, the fact that LNP set 2035 as the date suggests to me that he isnt serious.

  
**Secondly, If renewables are so cheap, why are my powerbills getting more expensive?**

ABC source a lot of this, but here is my understanding of it, and im happy to be corrected.

[https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-24/energy-bills-still-rising-despite-falling-wholesale-prices/103741682](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-24/energy-bills-still-rising-despite-falling-wholesale-prices/103741682)

  
There are 2 prices that matter on the Australian Energy Market. The wholesale cost per megawatt and the retail cost per megawatt.

The energy generators (power station, solar plant, wind farm), set a wholesale price for each megawatt of energy they generate. This can increase or decrease with demand.

The Australian Energy Regulator sets a ""Default Market Offer"" which is the maximum price retailers can charge. It as a certain percentage increase of the total costs (wholesale price, profit margin, network costs, environmental cost).  
The DMO is calculated as an average of the wholesale costs over a period of time. Meaning that since coal has gone up significantly in cost, it drags the DMO up even higher than it was a few years ago.  The volitale nature of our current grid generation also feeds into the higher wholesale cost and therefore the DMO

[https://www.energyfactsaustralia.org.au/key-issues/energy-costs/](https://www.energyfactsaustralia.org.au/key-issues/energy-costs/)  
According to a report these guys grabbed from The Grattan Institute back in 2017, a bill on average is made up of

* wholesale electricity costs make up 34%
* retail costs and profit margins make up 16%
* network costs make up between 43%
* environmental costs make up between 6%.

  
Now heres the bit where ive mostly just speculated.

It is not in the interest of retailers for coal to disappear. While the percentage of the profit margin wont change, the actual number gets bigger the higher the wholesale cost it. So at the moment, the profit margin for coal is much higher than for renewables.

So they are going to drag their feet and fight at every opportunity because if we were somehow on 100% renewables tomorrow, their wholesale costs would plummit and so would the retail cost and profit margin.

Now, we can fix the volatility with storage. And we are offering the generators great government incentives to build the storage.

However, as explained earlier, the generators make more money if the demand for energy is high and supply is low. So it is directly counter to their interests to build this storage. There are some private investors going with the idea of building the grid level battery and buying energy and charing while cheap, then feeding it back in when expensive. But again, its a ballencing act. Its only expensive in the peak times because we dont have enough supply. If we had too much supply, its not much of a profit.

This is why i think it is insane we havent just nationalised this whole thing. It would cut out the generators dragging their feet to incease profits, it would cut out the retailers fighting against the move to renewables so their can have a higher profit margin, it would cut out having to put such huge incentives to have private investors build the batteries themselves.

We could just build the generation, build the storage, and charge customers much closer to the wholesale price, since the government isnt trying to maximise profits.

Just as an additional note. While nuclear is more expensive than renewables, produced in large enough amounts it is very competative with coal. Theres a decent chance the generators and retailers dont what that move either, but it would be the best of two bad choices for them.

  
Anyway, thats all i have. I would love for people to correct anything ive messed up with, and would love to be pointed to some data and reports that will expand my understanding of all this. As i said, im not an engineer. And anyone who isnt an expert on this should be able to trust the experts.",129,153,isisius,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1dky1rp/can_a_qualified_engineer_or_adjacent_field_who/,2024-06-21 07:15:02,"The part that I would dispute in this essay really is your speculation part, as I believe you are looking at the investment profile of a generator wrong.

Companies that invest in things like power plants are the same types of entity as invest in toll roads.  You are investing in an asset that will have a demand for a long period of time with a reliable income stream associated with it.  Companies that are investing in these types of assets are looking for stable returns, not spectacular ones.

The reason we are in the position we are in is because there has been a lack of an energy policy in Australia for 15 years.  There has been zero guidance industry can work to as to what the long term goals of the energy makeup will be, so major investment decisions simply cannot be made.  This has resulted in a starvation of capital, and a starvation of maintenance.  Because who the fuck knows where we are going to be tomorrow.

Lets say youre a company and you are looking for a place to build a massive solar farm and battery storage facility, and you're looking around the world for where to make that investment.  You look at Australia and you see a stable economy, a stable political system, an educated workforce and a friendly environment to foreign investment.  Gold.  Lets go.

Hang on.  Shit.  The Coalition, which are the number 1 opposition party and were in government for the previous 11 years just said they are going to put a limit on the amount of renewables that could be built!!??!!  We need to reprice our risk on this one.  Those guys only just lost the last election and it wasn't by a landslide, there is a strong chance they will get back in, so lets sit tight.  Actually lets spend our money in a different country.

Most coal plants in Australia are coming up to end of life.  They need to be shut down, and their maintenance costs are increasing.  Origin energy doesn't want to keep operating Eraring station for example.  The ash tailings dam there is approaching capacity and the plant is more expensive to run than competing renewables.  The degree of how much they wanted to shut it down it shown by the fact they had to be paid to keep it open.

Australia has been failed by its politicians not having an energy policy.  And it's fucking depressing that the conversation is still happening despite the coalition not being in power.

That's an intense amount of info for a question! I am an electrical engineer working at a renewable energy company with about 14 years of experience in the energy industry. My current project that I am director of will be one of the largest solar and battery projects in Australia once it is built approx end of 2026.

To distill your question down, the reason we should do renewables rather than nuclear is because of cost. Our CSIRO and the AEMO have looked into this in detail and have produced the papers you referenced. They are literally the experts in this area and only produce these papers to benefit the end user of electricity. At the absolute cheapest estimate of cost, nuclear will be three times more expensive than renewables (with included installed batteries). It would VERY likely be a lot more expensive than that.

In addition the schedule and policy risk is much worse for nuclear. Nuclear power is outright banned in most Australian states and most of the locations the LNP have suggested are not even land owned by the government. We do not have nuclear specialists in Australia and the idea that it would be running in ten years is laughable, even by the most pronuclear people I know.

In Australia we have a situation where the coal is getting too old and must retire. We have some of the best solar and wind in the world and some of the best experts in the world too! Honestly the future is bright and we don't need nuclear power. SA is already mostly renewable.

It's actually kind of cool that someone asked something I'm somewhat knowledgeable on, so if you have specific questions let me know.
---
Genuinely, it has to be nationalised. Or you need to legislate in such a way that no government can fuck about with the laws for atleast 10 years (which is very dodgy). Because the fact is it's just a big investment that no private capital is going to make without guarantees of a ROI.


Basically the problem with renewables are that they are beholden to market rates for electricity so for some cases where they can be tied directly to a fixed end point user you can get past that sort of stuff but jumping into the grid is a much riskier investment.


There's a podcast by Bloomberg's odd lot - ""are we decarbonizing the wrong way"" which is pretty good about discussing renewable energy pricing.
---
Thank you. I doubt you will get any reasonable responses, partly because the moment you said ""nationalise the grid"" you would have triggered all the free-market capitalists.   
One factor not mentioned is that renewables lets a lot of new entrants into the equation as VC's and private businesses invest where the current generators / retailers are not. A Nuclear pathway would kill that investment, putting control back into the hands of the current generators.

I've done some work with energy grid providers and some power generators, I am not a engineer in that field specifically but I understand some broad strokes as to how power gets from generation to user. I can reiterate some stuff I've said on Reddit before but the way I look at it is this:

You have a bulk energy grid, that is where the power stations and power providers (not all providers are stations) live on. It takes energy from them in the form of high voltage lines to the retail grid. It will buy from the cheapest available source to sell to the retailer grid. The bulk energy grid can be thought of as the big lines that have to carry a lot of power through a pretty limited number of channels relatively.

The retail grid takes power from the bulk energy providers and pipes it to homes. It does this through the local grids which are obviously more spread out and complex than the bulk energy grid with lines piping power to most every home within a smaller more populated area.

Both of those grids have to be maintained, power creates wear on lines, power is transmitted as high voltage and the further away it has to travel the more that is lost through the lines. The power lost can obviously create wear on those lines that needs to be maintained.

Ok so.

Renewables that can be smaller scale can operate much closer to populated areas which reduces the amount of power loss through transmission. It also means that power can be more decentralised meaning there is not (oversimplified) a big thick single cable of power coming into the retail grid. The closer the distance between the generation and the consumption the less that is lost and less wear on the power grid.

The most ideal state is where you have multiple power generation points that exist on the retail grid so that there is no central point of failure and that power can not be lost in transmission. The best example being solar panels directly on the roof of the consumer for the sake of distributing the generation of power at the retail grid level and reducing load on the grid where spikes in consumption may occur.

100% of what I just said has nothing to do with Nuclear vs Renewables, but Nuclear is a centralised power generator that would live on the bulk energy grid and need to compete with renewables which can exist in the form of solar farms, wind, etc. Given the bulk energy grid is largely automatic in terms of how it buys and doesn't care in the slightest of the opinion of any potato you just need \*to look at the cost of generation.

The energy grid is very cost and profit driven. There are power generators that may sell to the bulk energy grid like factories using gas power generators who will turn off their power generators and take from the grid if it is cheaper to run off the grid, likewise if the power grid is more expensive they might sell what they are generating directly for profit instead of using it.",2024-06-21 07:15:02,True
Parenting,social media age restriction Australia,Advice Needed - Ex refuses our 7 year old sun block as she believes it causes cancer.,"So a bit of context first. We live in Australia. The sun is hot and the UV index is usually extreme. My (38M) ex (39F) in the last year or so now believes that all sun block causes cancer and refuses to let our 7 year old daughter wear it. We have 50/50 custody, week on week off. 

This is a fairly new opinion of hers and I'm guessing is the influence of her new partner of one year. According to my child both of them and his two kids (13 and 16) aren't allowed to / don't wear sun block and all love sun tanning. They also live across the road from a beach so are always there. 

After my ex initially told me that sun block causes cancer and she would no longer let our daughter wear it, firstly I tried to explain that, that's nonsense but she refused to listen to reason. I left it at, well sun burn has been scientifically proven to cause skin cancer so if you are refusing to put sun block on our daughter she just can't get burnt. That means she'll always need a hat, long sleeves etc at the beach and can't be out in the sun long. This was probably 6 months ago. 

Fast forward to 2 months ago. They are all at a water park / camping ground and she sends me a photo of my daughter having fun (which I am grateful for) but she is only wearing a bikini. No hat, no sun cream, no long sleeves. Upon handover she is returned to my Dad's house as it's school holidays and she is so badly burnt that she is blistered on her shoulders, neck and back. She is in pain for days. My Dad's wife tells my ex that if that happens again she will report her as it is abuse. My ex's response is to look straight at our daughter and say "" I told you to stay in the shade"" She still doesn't seem to care and explains it causes cancer taking no responsibility.

Fast forward to last night, my ex blows up at me for showing our daughter a photo of a leather skinned old lady who never wears sun block and sun tans after she asking me why I thought sun tanning was bad. My ex  said I was instilling fear into our daughter to stop her doing things they all loved doing together. 

My daughter understands that sun block works and is safe to use. She wants to wear it and has even asked if she can sneak a small roll on in her back pack to her  Mum's house as she is too scared to ask her if she can wear it and sneak it on before she goes out to the beach.

I'm worried for my daughter's well-being, the mental stress of it all and that she will keep getting burnt or even worse her head will be filled with this nonsense.

Did you take photos of your daughter's blisters? Did you guys also take her to the doctor so there's a record? 


I'm also in Australia. Your ex is insane. Anyone who lives here know you can get burnt even within 15 minutes of a light stroll outside. 


I will give your daughter sunblock for her to put on herself. Maybe ask your daughter before going to the beach with her mum, ask to change in the bathroom and she can put the sunblock there without her mum knowing. 


BUT, I reckon you should talk to your lawyer. Because I agree with your dad's wife. Ask your lawyer whether this counts as abuse. And perhaps it's time to change the custody arrangements so you have main custody. Because if this were me, I'm putting my foot down. We can all have parenting differences but endangering my child because you decide you know more than an entire scientific and medical community is just stupidity to the max.

I feel awful for your daughter. There is a good chance her mother will be able to smell sunscreen on her or feel it on her skin if she tries to sneak it, though. I'm not sure if there are scent-free options or ones that aren't as easy to feel on the skin. It's especially dangerous considering where you live and the amount of sun exposure she seems to get at your ex's household. I'm not sure who you would contact about this... Your daughter's pediatrician might be one resource? But it's definitely not something to just let go, since it's an issue of her safety.
---
Ugh. While I don't condone the ignorance, would she maybe allow a zinc based barrier sunscreen be used? Most of the anti sunscreen crowd are all over them as the only option to avoid the *chemicals*. Most kids hate them because they are thick and can be irritating to the skin but it's better than nothing. Something like MooGoo brand seems to be regularly recommended in that crowd. 

Otherwise, yeah the child is coming to harm with the other parent, it's time to get this injury documented by your Dr and speak to a  family lawyer.",2025-01-21 23:59:26,False

If you're a person of interest then absolutely nothing

Broadly speaking? 

-Use a fake/canned email

-Never install a social media app on a device (there 
are some android apps that allow sandboxed installs that may be enough)

-never validate w a real phone number (this one can be hard bc most spot VOIP numbers

-never upload info that could be linked to you, photos fall under that, but you could theoretically scrub metadata, take screenshots instead of uploading originals, etc. But be wary, AI scanning of content could determine info abt you from pics alone

Social media sites are going to log as much as possible abt you. VPNs could help prevent a company from corroborating your identity by comparing connections from your IP, but VPNs don't make you anonymous in general.

Am I crazy to think my baby will not have an iPad?,"Recently I read that an astonishing amount of Americans can’t read beyond a middle school level and that and even more astonishing amount haven’t read a book in a long frickin time. I really don’t want this for my baby. Right now he’s 8 monthmonths old and I do everything I can to promote literacy. We read together , have books out all the time, I even read my books in front of him while he’s just playing in his play area.  

I think the real root of the problem is technology. I see friends on social media post about their every day lives and a shocking amount of them post their kids just chilling at ages four, five, six - all on iPads. Am I delusional and think that I simply won’t give my kid a device? I was a teacher for six years and I know problems with technology. 

So, I come here to ask: parents, are you giving your kids technology or not? How are we navigating this?  Am I crazy to think I just simply will never give my kid an iPad?

I think you have to use your own judgement and know your kid. If you know they will throw a tantrum, I wouldn't allow it.

We have books around the house and she ""reads"" them. I also read to her. If we are reading about horses, we watch a documentary about horses or a cartoon that has horses in it.

Overall, we don't do iPads. We go to the store, the mall, just about anywhere, we don't do iPads. At first it was difficult but she learn to behave in public. Children need to learn how to behave, but society wants them quiet since day one.

My kids are 3 and 6. We don't own a tablet, no plans to own a tablet. We have a laptop and my 6 year old uses it for 30 minutes a week, supervised, while he works on two programs for school. My 3 year old does not get computer time. We're doing just fine with no tablets.
---
We take an “all things in moderation” approach that works well. Our 4 year old watches maybe 3-4 hours of TV a week, usually decompressing after school, and maybe 1-2 hours on good apps (we playtest them) like Sago Mini on weekends. It went up a bit when the baby was born and then down again. 

The result is that he’s familiar with technology and enjoys it, but also loves books and visiting the library. He’ll also happily sit with a picture book or coloring book while we’re in a coffee shop or restaurant, which lets us maintain a strict no screens at the table rule. 

We are a family of video game developers, also, so the house is full of tech our kids will use in time. But it’s really important to us that they learn how to be bored and how to focus on a less-stimulating task or activity before then.
---
You’re not delusional, you can just choose to not give it to them. But they do need to know how technology works.

My problem is that a lot of kids, and even young adults, cannot operate technology beyond selecting a picture of an app. I’m 29, you had to know how programs functioned and operated to work them. We were understanding code and the mechanisms behind websites. We typed on a keyboard and knew how to operate a mouse. A lot of that is lost with apps and tablets.

So I would promote technology literacy, as well as reading literacy for your kids. Teach them about tech and how to work it, and educate them on the dangers of the internet.

Parenting,kids off social media,12 year old is having a lot of issues with appropriate behavior online.,"UPDATE:

So, we've looked into more ways we can get him out and making more friends in the real world. I think, at its root, the issue is one of lack of community. He might feel that because he isn't active online the way the other kids are, he is therefore lacking something. He goes every Sat/Sun for tabletop games at the local shops, where he plays games with both children and adults in the hobby. We've looked into camp ideas and that's a negative. It's too expensive for us off the bat and that's pretty disheartening. There are a lot of library programs and community events. I also have a lot of events through college that I can bring him to with me, so that's an option. I'm a bit limited with my leg injury (i.e, no driving), so it'll take some coordination, but it's do-able. The other activities in the area are more pay-to-do. We aren't opposed to that at all, we are only opposed to the price hikes for things that weren't so costly last summer or the summer prior. There are free and inexpensive things to do to make up for that. I'm feeling positive overall about getting him more active in the community.

My son and his father went out to find good boredom breakers for him on his downtime. Before leaving, my son said: ""So I can get anything right?"" And I said, ""Within reason AND it has to help you in some way!""

They returned with a blank comic book (for him to draw in), music (mostly Taylor Swift, he's a hardcore Swiftie), a new book series, more crossword puzzles, a bag of chocolates (because feelings), and a new puzzle and picture frame for me to soften the blow of also bringing home a PUPPY. 

We were going to get a puppy, and had actively been planning for one, up until my injury. That's when all things puppy related were put on firm pause. She'll be around 4 months old when I'm projected to be recovering nicely from surgery. We have a broad network of friends that either work exclusively in the pet industry OR have dogs of their own. I worked as an assistant pet trainer, I groomed dogs of all sizes and breeds, volunteered at the Pitbull Rescue, and have been volunteering at animal shelters since I was younger. Those experiences alone soften the blow of her random arrival. The new puzzle helps too. I've been putting it together with her laying at my feet. It has been nice. We also had dog items in our pet tote from the preparation period, so she's (so far) been an inexpensive delight. That is subject to change at any given point in time so I am trying to be extremely mindful about this. I have a disabled cat and have a close relationship with our vet (given the amount of care he's needed). She's phenomenal and if ever there's an emergency, she works to make sure care is affordable. I'm going to try and process this in a more reassuring way.

She was the last of her litter and wasn't very adoptable due to her timid behavior. She shook from head to toe. Initially, the two were only going to stop by and look before coming home and bringing it up to me. My son said that he didn't feel like he could ""leave that place and go touch grass without her."" Everyone is over the moon. I'm still processing the fact there's a dog in the house. An actual puppy that is our puppy. I do still have issues with the impulsiveness of it and the lack of communication. I think that it's a tricky situation for me to navigate. On one hand, I do feel bothered by the lack of consideration for such a monumental change. On the other hand, we'd already prepared (as a family) to bring a dog into our lives, so the concept of one isn't foreign, and a dog is certainly NOT unwanted.

I'm also convinced she's a Ninja Turtle with the way she's come out of her shell. She trembles still sometimes but is easily soothed and seems very receptive to being loved. She's very clearly afraid of men but we've noticed that she is more comfortable when my partner isn't wearing shoes. I dislike shoes on in the house so she's really helping foster a cleaner floor and better house manners, if you think about it. (Gotta be positive.) I do want to get her to understand that we put shoes on to go outside, so if she can associate shoes with going outside and not shoes with danger, we can really get her over the fear. I hate seeing her trembling like that. I understand why my son was adamant about not leaving her behind. The way she looks at him is almost as if she's hugging his heart.

Everything I needed from his phone has been given to the proper authorities. One person had their Instagram linked to their Discord, and I was able to bring this to the attention of their family. The others, I also submitted their info to people who bait/catch predators (or at least out them). I think that's the best I can do on that regard since I am not Liam Nissan.

That is the overall update. I won't post another but if I have any further questions, concerns, or need any further input, I will definitely be posting here again. Despite the general negative response, I have a really good idea for what my next steps are going to be. Thank you to everyone except for: the perverts in my inbox and the people who didn't read the post.

To those who messaged me and asked if I wanted your help baiting my son, I hope you are haunted by an invisible cricket that only chirps at night. I hope you never find the perfect balance between hot and cold. May your food be flavorless. If you have to go present something, I hope you (gen) go out there and break a leg. Preferably both. I hope that on the most important day of your life, you have diarrhea with no bathroom in sight. I wish you great failure in life. I hope you get arrested, tazed, and get dragged down the sidewalk in a puddle of your own urine. I truly, from the bottom of my heart, wish you the worst. 

To those who messaged me with good intentions: Thank you.

To everyone else: I appreciate your input and I am exploring all alternative options. I have a bountiful list of either flips/watches to explore. There were a lot of people in this thread that took issue with the fact he needed one for school. I live in America. Did you know that there are a lot of risks associated with living in America? I don't see that as any reason to crucify the use of having a phone at school. I can see the logic that goes into being against having a SMARTPHONE at school, but that wasn't the issue. The issue some took was that he had a phone at school, period. 

He will still have some way to contact me in the event of an emergency. This is somehow controversial and I find that very bizarre.

I've also been considering one comment in particular, where it was suggested a family computer be put into the main room, the way it was when I was a bit younger. My son has been pretty intense in the coding business and there's an interactive site that helps teach python in a way that he would be able to understand. I think that this is an exceptional idea.

There are a lot of misconceptions. 

-He has been in therapy for 2 years, since the 1st incident. This therapist was highly recommended to us after we spoke to authorities. He has a counselor that visits him at school, independent from the school counselor. People think he needs a new therapist. My son doesn't want a new therapist. This is still a topic for further exploration.

-My son says that he is surrounded by children who have phones and are active on social media, and how he feels like he's out of the loop on that front. He said that, initially, he had only downloaded Discord and Roblox to play with friends from school. His intent came from a good place but led him down a dark path.

-This is the first incident since the former. It has been going on for >2 weeks. I did not check his phone in that time-frame. A lot of people had similar issues with my inaction there. I was still operating under the idea that to build trust, I needed to give him more grace when it came to random phone checks. There had been no issues accounted for, so I did extend more grace by not subjecting him to day-to-day phone checks.

-I don't know why he had his phone at night. A lot of people were taking an issue with that being allowed. It wasn't.

-I am nursing a leg injury and have surgery next month. All of my work (school and work-work) is online. It isn't feasible to change the wifi password everyday and I don't know why people are acting like that is the most outrageous thing I could possibly say. Those who insist I do should try changing their device passwords and wifi passwords every day for the next 2 weeks, then come back and tell me what your experience was in doing that. I think it's one of those things that you won't find tedious or challenging until you experience it yourself, so I encourage you all to take your own advice and let me know how it worked out for you and yours. I stand by the fact that changing my wifi password and device passwords every day, indefinitely, is ridiculous and not beneficial to the long-term.

-My son isn't a mean child. He isn't hateful. He doesn't throw tantrums because he gets into trouble. He isn't mature in the least bit and I am not going to parade around my own post, swearing that he is. I will say that he has better conversation skills than half of you people and he is only twelve. He is a very good kid. He hasn't been mean, hateful, hostile, or whatever. He hasn't complained, begged, argued, or tried to convince me otherwise. I really need you all to understand that he isn't mean spirited, because a lot of you are implying that he is and that getting in trouble is going to turn him into some kind of hellraiser. He's not like that. Our day-to-day has been overall normal, with the exception of more serious talks in between about the guilt/confusion he feels. I have zero concerns he will steal a phone or buy one (like many have suggested). I have zero concerns for his behavior at all. He's not going to raise hell as some of you swore he would. The concern I had, and stated in my initial post, was the concern for his MENTAL WELLBEING. Not concern for whether or not he'd act out upon not receiving his phone back.

-It is also valid to express concern for your child's mental and emotional wellbeing, especially if they have struggled with that in the past. Don't understand why that is also a controversial take. I am wondering how many of you are actually parents. If you aren't a parent and not planning on being a parent, then what are you doing engaging on a Parenting subreddit?

-Also wondering how many read the entire post before replying, because a lot of the accusatory comments and questions were covered in the initial post.

-I talk to my son all the time. I am his friend but he understands I am his mother FIRST and FOREMOST. I am not trying to be a cool mom. I'm a cringe mom that turns vocabulary words into rap battles. (Did you know it's a great way to also teach poetry?) Cringe, yes, but at least I'm making them laugh. People say that I'm trying to be his best friend-- I already am, no need to try. It's important to foster that kind of relationship with your child. People who aren't friends with their child are just authority figures and only that. This leaves room for less laughter, less conversations, just... less.

-Some people said something like: ""You're the parent! Just take it. No discussion. Nothing."" I disagree with this method of parenting. It is essential to discuss the reasons why. If I am sending my son to time-out, he'll understand the reasons why. He will sit in one of the reading chairs, pick a book (or sit quietly and reflect, his choice). Afterwards, we talk about what the issue was, why it was an issue, and how we can avoid it next time. Discussions are necessary. I question what it must be like to grow up with a parent that doesn't communicate like that.

-I stand by the PowerPoint and no I will not be elaborating further.

-I understand where the majority of concern is coming from given the nature of his interactions. I'm not bothered or upset by the negative responses to my post/replies. I sought out this subreddit because, again, what I was doing wasn't working. I received guidance from multiple outlets and followed all the plans, but in the end, it didn't work. In saying that, I do think that therapy has helped and a lot of the steps we took with him were absolutely beneficial. I asked PARENTS because I knew that the responses would come from a place of genuine concern, not clinical concern the way it was with his therapist. I needed a leveled dose of reality. I genuinely do appreciate all critical and constructive opinions offered to me. I especially appreciate the comments that also came with ideas on what I could be doing. And thank you to every person who, in solidarity, explained their own past interactions online and/or what they'd experienced with their own children.

-However: Berating someone for asking for clarification is strange and I can't understand the thought process behind that. I'm autistic. It is hard to understand tone/reasoning in even a ""normal"" situation. If I asked for clarification, it was because I misinterpreted or just did not fully understand what you said. I tried to reply to the majority of comments. It felt counter productive because it's bringing my karma thing down. I looked it up and if someone has too much negative karma in a specific sub, they might not be able to comment/post in that sub or their posts are more likely to be removed. So yes, counter-productive.",116,316,hiraeth__0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1csuww9/12_year_old_is_having_a_lot_of_issues_with/,2024-05-15 20:28:12,"r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

I don’t mean to sound harsh but you would “be an absolute asshole” if you DID give him his phone back. 

If he really needs a phone for emergencies, there are phones without internet browsing available.

Why does he have access to the phone after he’s suppose to be in bed asleep? Take it and lock it up if you need to.

> Would I be an absolute asshole if I just did not give him his phone back? Reset and pocket it?

No. You'd be failing your child if you didn't. 

My spidey sense tells me something else is going on here besides the technology boundaries issue, and that is probably best addressed in therapy. Also consider whether you need some help for yourself with processing this conflict and setting / keeping healthy boundaries. This is a lot to deal with, and it can be even harder when hits so close to your own field of expertise.",2024-05-15 20:28:12,False
Parenting,young people and social media ban,Mom guilt over Halloween ,"I will admit that Halloween is not my jam, as a kid I liked it of course.. candy! But as I got older it’s never been something I really look forward to. But this isn’t about that.. 
so far the only Halloween things we’ve done are go to the pumpkin patch and carve (5) pumpkins. Tonight (Halloween day) we’ll go trick or treating. 
Why do I have mom guilt over this? Why is Halloween trick or treating now 5 different events?! My son is almost 4 and I have a 10 week old.. and I feel so bad that all I’m doing is taking him trick or treating. Not trunk or treating, or downtown trick or treating this morning, etc etc. I don’t remember doing anything more as a kid than what we plan on doing. Besides a Halloween parade at school!
I see people doing all the events and really going for it (love that for them!) but I just don’t have the bandwidth (and also realize like I said, Halloween isn’t reaaallly my thing). 
Is anyone else in the boat I’m in? Am I a terrible boring mother?!

UPDATE: whoa, I’ve never had a post blow up like this. I really appreciate all of the responses! A few things I want to touch on. I love that a few recommended a social media break, ironically I deleted the apps a few days ago because I noticed myself comparing and got the ick from it - the comparison, the over consumption, the performance of things and the hype up of every single event. It’s unrealistic and exhausting! 
Secondly, I don’t ACTUALLY think I haven’t done enough. I know logically I am doing enough, and even if I did less that would still be ok. Unfortunately I am delusional and have mom guilt literally no.matter.what. Yes I am in therapy. 
Finally, this post wasn’t to say I’m not enjoying things and purely comparing. I just decided last minute not to haul the littles downtown to trick or treat, and I was having a moment. Going from one kiddo to two has really sent me for a loop with everything.

SECOND UPDATE: this comment thread is everything so many of us needed to hear. Thank you everyone!!!

What? What else is there to do? What you did is basically the standard Halloween tradition. I’m not sure what more you could do.
---
You have a 10 week old. Let me say this again: you have a 10 week old.

Taking your child around the block is plenty. I'm doing that with my one year old.

Halloween has become way too much lately - too many events, boo baskets, etc. Your little guy is only 3 AND you have a newborn. I think it’s healthier for kids in the long run to have healthy expectations around holidays that aren’t based around consuming and buying. Spending time at the pumpkin patch, carving pumpkins, and going trick or treating with a costume is plenty of holiday spirit for a preschooler.",2024-10-31 14:26:43,False
AustralianPolitics,social media age restriction Australia,Advance’s plan to destroy the Greens,"**Advance’s plan to destroy the Greens** 

**Jason Koutsoukis is The Saturday Paper’s special correspondent, August 17, 2024** 

Hard-right campaign group Advance is amassing a multimillion-dollar war chest to hammer the Australian Greens at the next federal election.

Describing the Greens as the single biggest threat to freedom, security and prosperity in Australia, Advance executive director Matthew Sheahan has told supporters he wants to shrink the Greens’ share of the national senate vote by 4 percentage points and cut their vote in the lower house by 2 percentage points.

He said Advance’s strategy would target mostly women voters and be focused on people aged between 33 and 49.

“We’re not going to stop there,” Sheahan told an online forum last month. “We’ve got to continue after the next federal election to try and expose the Greens for who they are, and to try and get their vote back to the 4 or 5 per cent core radical rump.”

At the last federal election in May 2022, the Greens won six Senate seats, with 12.66 per cent of the vote, bringing the party’s total Senate numbers to 11. The Greens won four House of Representatives seats, with 12.25 per cent of the lower house vote.

Sheahan said if Advance met its goal of shrinking the Greens’ vote to 8.65 per cent in the Senate and 10.2 per cent in the lower house, it would erase entirely the party’s gains since 2016.

Advance is also expected to target three lower house seats where the Greens are considered a chance of dislodging incumbent candidates: the Liberal-held seat of Sturt in Adelaide, the Labor-held seat of Richmond in northern NSW and the Labor-held seat of Macnamara in metropolitan Melbourne.

“We’re actually doing nothing else between now and the next federal election but this campaign,” Sheahan said. “We think it’s so important that someone expose the Greens for who they are and reduce their power, their toxic power in this country. No one else has the ability to do it or the will to do it.”

Touting Advance’s 306,000 online supporters and 32,000 donors, Sheahan said the group had already raised $1.5 million of its $5 million fundraising goal ahead of the next election, enabling it to hire 23 full-time staff and expand its permanent campaign infrastructure to include data analytics, creative, digital, communications, fundraising, political strategy and a call centre.

Advance has also appointed a former Australian Federal Police officer, Sandra Bourke, as its new national spokesperson. She fills the gap left by Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, the Country Liberal Party senator who became the face of the “No” campaign in last year’s Voice referendum.

Founded in 2018 with $280,000 in seed funding contributed by retired Sydney financier Simon Fenwick, Advance shot to national prominence during the Voice referendum, with the group’s aggressive campaigning across multiple platforms credited with crippling the “Yes” campaign.

Despite collecting only $1.3 million in donations ahead of the referendum, Advance spent $10.4 million on the “No” campaign. Its affiliate group, Australians for Unity, spent $11.8 million after raising $10.8 million in donations.

In March, Advance spent a further $300,000 urging voters to put Labor last in the Dunkley byelection. Advertising during that race focused on the cost of living and the release of people from immigration detention but failed to stop Labor increasing its primary vote.

In the months before the Dunkley campaign, Sheahan said, Advance spent time assessing the greatest threats to the “fruits of the Judaeo-Christian West” – the defence of which he said was at the core of the group’s mission. “And after about two weeks of research,” he said, “we discovered that it was the Greens.”

Sheahan said the research, commissioned in January, involved quantitative polling of about 4500 people, while the qualitative research involved 25 one-on-one interviews with target voters across three focus groups.

“We instructed the researchers that we wanted to understand what the Australian people thought about the political parties from a brand point of view,” Sheahan said.

“We didn’t want to know about what people thought about the policies or the politicians … We wanted people to think about, ‘Okay, think about the parties as Nike or Apple or Toyota. How do they make you feel? What values do they hold?’ None of the survey was closed questions. We didn’t provide any of the answers.”

The results indicated that for the Liberals, 29 per cent of respondents said the party’s brand stood for nothing, 25 per cent saw it as looking after big business and the rich, 17 per cent nominated strong economic management, 16 per cent saw the Liberals primarily as a right-leaning, conservative party and 8 per cent said the party represented small business.

For Labor, 37 per cent of respondents said the party was primarily about looking after workers, 26 per cent saw the party as standing for nothing, 16 per cent nominated equal opportunity for all, 10 per cent said Labor’s main reason for being was to look after themselves and 7 per cent said Labor stood for wildlife, water and the environment.

“People don’t understand anymore what these guys stand for from a values point of view,” Sheahan said, “and that’s a problem for those two parties.”

For the Nationals, 47 per cent of respondents said the party stood for nothing, 20 per cent nominated supporting the regions, 15 per cent said looking after farmers and agriculture, 8 per cent said looking after big business and the rich and 8 per cent said equal opportunity for all.

“The National Party? Well, they’re in real trouble,” said Sheahan. “That 47 per cent think they believe in nothing, which is, you know, if you own that brand, you’d probably trade it in.”

When it came to the Greens, however, Advance’s research showed that 52 per cent of respondents said the Greens stood for looking after the local environment, water and wildlife, while 26 per cent nominated action on climate change.

Only 20 per cent of respondents said the party stood for nothing. Eight per cent said the Greens were about looking after the disadvantaged, and 6 per cent saw the party as either left-leaning, progressive or socialist.

“There’s 78 per cent of the Australian people – not just Greens voters but all voters – think they either stand for action on climate or protecting the environment,” Sheahan said. “So, they clearly have the strongest brand in this country, politically.”

With most people falling into the category of being either undecided or a “low information” voter, Sheahan said, many Australians turned up to vote not knowing what either of the major parties stood for. He summarised the thinking as this: “I don’t really want to be here anyway. I’m disinterested in politics. If I vote for the Greens, at least No. 1, I’m going to feel good about something that I did today.”

Instead of attacking the Greens head-on as a party wanting to enact radical change, Sheahan said Advance would try to meet voters where they were with the message the Greens “are not what they used to be”.

“We’ve got to be a bit more softly, softly in the beginning – and this is the message that tested the best out of the research,” Sheahan said. “It’s good for a couple of reasons, at least at the theoretical level, because it gives the voter permission to say, ‘Well, I haven’t changed. They have. And I wasn’t stupid for voting for them because I didn’t know they weren’t who they used to be.’ ”

Whether the election was in three months or nine months, Sheahan said, Advance would spend all its considerable resources and effort targeting the two thirds of Greens voters it thought were persuadable, first with the “softly, softly” approach.

The centrepiece of Advance’s so-called “Greens Truth” campaign will be a documentary film with a $317,000 production budget that promises to tell the “full story of why the Greens have fallen so far”.

According to a fundraising pitch emailed to supporters on Thursday, the film will not only inform and motivate voters on its own but will also be used as the basis for social media, television advertisements and other campaign material to “make sure no Aussie is left in the dark about the TRUTH”.

After that, Sheahan said, Advance would revert to messaging focused on “here’s what they’re really like”.

“We’ll use the same sort of techniques we used during the Voice, where we can geotarget messaging using our propensity model scoring and our database, to actually get a message to predominantly women aged between 33 and 49 who are persuadable, who do think the Greens are just doing the right thing by the environment but don’t know anything else,” Sheahan said. “We think we can persuade quite a considerable lot of them.”

Spearheading that message will be the newly appointed Advance spokesperson, Sandra Bourke, who declined an invitation to speak to *The Saturday Paper*.

In an introductory video posted on Advance’s social media channels, Bourke said she started out as a “young officer in the federal police, then the National Crime Authority, before serving in national security and defence”.

“Up until now, I have never been politically active,” Bourke claimed in the introductory video, despite the fact she stood as an independent candidate in the Mid-Coast Council elections in New South Wales in 2021.

Since then, Bourke has been actively involved in a local campaign against an offshore wind zone declared near her home town of Tea Gardens.

Insisting she spoke every day to farmers who were being reduced to tears as their land was acquired to make way for the roll-out of renewables, and to shattered small business owners who were being driven into the ground by red and green tape, Bourke identified herself as a quiet Australian who could no longer watch from the sidelines.

“For me, it was like pulling on a thread,” Bourke said. “I discovered that the Labor, teal and Green government’s roll-out of turbines is gutting Australia. It is tearing up farmers and families and their land, but more importantly, it is tearing up your cost of living. It is gutting our economy.”

Fresh from the parliamentary winter break that saw Greens volunteers knock on more than 50,000 doors across the country, Australian Greens leader Adam Bandt said he was unfazed by the threat posed by Advance. He told *The Saturday Paper* that voters trusted the party because it consistently fought for the things people cared about.

“We’ve got thousands of people across the country who are knocking on doors and being part of our people-power movement,” Bandt said. “I expect that, you know, Advance will try and gather as much money as they can to throw whatever they can at us. You can flood the airwaves as much as you like, but what people are craving at the moment is a connection with people who are fighting for change, and when we build that people-powered movement and have those conversations on the doors, and give people a sense of hope that politics can be different, we see that seats can change hands and can affect the direction of the country.”

While Advance may have a few wealthy donors, Bandt said, a key question to ask of the group was why they are doing what they’re doing.

“The conservatives are attacking the Greens and not Labor because we’re the progressive alternative, and at this election, with commentators predicting a minority parliament, we will be in a really strong position to fight for people and to take on big corporations,” Bandt said.

“So, for us, it doesn’t change our strategy, which is to have that people-powered movement that’s based on those conversations we are having with people, because we know it works … They can put whatever they like on Facebook, but by that stage people have understood that we’re fighting for change. It might not happen overnight, but nothing changes if nothing changes.”",111,179,Enthingification,https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/politics/2024/08/17/advances-plan-destroy-the-greens,2025-05-07 07:20:43,"**Greetings humans.**

For all the bitching by conservatives about Climate 200 they sure were quiet about Advance Australia which is actually linked to the Liberal party and their huge spending during the election.  Climate 200 funded candidates that then used that funding how they saw fit which each candidate was ultimately responsible for the material published.  Advance run smear campaigns on behalf of the Liberals but the Liberals get the plausible deniability.

>Shortly after the mass Advance email this afternoon, The Australian newspaper published an article titled “Industry message to Labor: Greens are dead, now hit the gas”.

Social media giants are so annoying and constantly trying to sell. Nothing is genuine and it's all loud and ""LOOK AT ME LOOK AT ME"" 

I am on here, discord servers, and bluesky. I don't use my real face or my real name.

And it's been such a relief just getting to use the internet for fun and interests again- as you said, it reminds me of my early Internet days. 

Way more peaceful and less pressure.

>Even “old-school” hobbies like knitting, journaling, and gardening are making a comeback online. Add in short-form videos and AI content, and it’s clear social media is changing fast. 

What has been fascinating me is that those old-school hobbies have had stable communities online since Ye Olden Times (GeoCities). BUT, they have been getting a lot more traction, and a pretty cool influx of younger folks, in the last few years. I get the feeling (anecdotally) that its because those communities are actually possible to engage with reciprocally, they *engage back*.

Yeah totally feel this shift. I used to post only the “perfect” stuff on Instagram, now I just share random thoughts on close friend stories or chat more in small groups on Discord. It feels nicer, more real. Like I’m not trying to perform all the time. 

Even the content I watch now is chill – people sharing hobbies, simple life updates, no heavy filters. It kinda reminds me of early internet days where it was about fun, not followers. I think many of us just want to feel seen without all that pressure now.

Parenting,young people and social media ban,family members saying “my baby”,"I’m genuinely asking this because I feel like i’ve seen this all over social media and I just don’t see the big deal. I have 3 older sisters, all who have kids and I also have kids. My best friends have kids and basically we all throw “my baby” around all willy nilly. 

Like for example if I see my niece I say “Hiiii my baby” or “you look so pretty my baby” if I post  a picture with my niece or nephew back in the day I’d caption it “my sweet baby” or “titi’s baby” etc. My sisters and friends all do the same with my kids. When I walk into my sisters house with my babies my sisters always say “HII MY BABIES” to my baby & “titi’s baby” “look at my baby”. My mom and MIL both say things like “Hi my sweet baby” and “grandma’s baby” 

It literally doesn’t bother me at all & I remember people doing this for as long as i can remember. My sisters are much older than me so I was 6 when I became an aunt for the first time. I’d always say those things even back then. 

I guess i’m just not seeing the issue everyone is having but my sisters, my best friend, & I were talking about and thinking maybe we were crazy?? Ive always known tons of people who do this though, so Im just curious why it bothers people so much.

I assume it has to do with the relationships outside of this specific issue - if you already hate your inlaws, ""my baby"" is more evidence against them.  If you love your inlaws, it's not even something you notice.

I married into a large, close family and I honestly can't even remember if they call my kids their babies or not... I do remember my MIL patting my pregnant belly saying ""and this is my newest grandbaby"" and I didn't mind one bit.

I think it depends on how close you are with the people saying it. If a family member is not putting in effort to see my kids or be part of their life, they don’t get to call them “my baby”.

Oh I was totally one of those first time moms! Upon many years of reflection, I think I was just kind of messed up.

I haaaated when we would see family and they’d want to hold him the whole time because I felt like I wasn’t holding him enough because I was working all day. And anyone that called him “mine” felt like they might be replacing me (especially for those who spent more time with him than I did). 

It wasn’t rational but it was totally a thing. I don’t think I ever said anything to anyone and in my head I knew that the more people to love on him, the better. But I was an emotional wreck for months and months and it manifested in weird ways.",2025-03-18 19:18:36,False
AustralianPolitics,social media age restriction Australia,The IPA would love to be Australia's Heritage Foundation,"For those of you who don't know, the IPA is one of Australia's most influential right wing think tanks. Its Wikipedia page lists some of their founders as The Chairman of Coles supermarkets (G. J. Coles), the Chairman of BHP, and Keith Murdoch, The President of the Australian Council of Retailers, The President of the Victorian Chamber of Manufacturers, and a range of politicians and lawyers.      

Gina Rhinehart, and Rupert Murdoch, various Liberal Party big wigs, and lawyers, are all members and donors. The IPA has close ties to Liberal Party leaders, and the business elites of Australia.    

So what was the highly influential IPA pushing during the election? 

Well, according to [this article](https://ipa.org.au/ipa-review-articles/make-australia-great-again), they were pushing 60 policies their staff compiled for The Liberal's first year in office:               
   
**DOGE**   
> Appoint a ‘Director of Government Efficiency’ (Australia’s DOGE) responsible for working with government to eliminate waste, excess regulations, duplication of programs, and activities across all levels of government. Restructure government departments and agencies.    
> By 2028, reduce the number of Federal government employees involved in regulatory activity from the projected June 2025 level of approximately 100,000, to the June 2022 level of approximately 83,000.    
   
**Defence Increase**   
> Increase defence spending to at least 3 per cent of GDP by 2028 (from its current 2 per cent).   
   
**Nuclear Reactors**  
> Repeal the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 to relieve electricity retailers of the obligation to purchase renewable energy ‘certificates’ from wind, solar, and hydroelectric providers.    

**Gutting Environmental regulations**    
>Reduce the size and restrictiveness of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 to pre-2000 levels, and repeal section 487 of the Act, which allows environmental activists to delay nation-building projects in the courts.    
       
**Rolling environmental laws back to ""states rights""**      
> stop the establishment of the duplicative Environment Protection Australia, and devolve environmental regulation to the States and Territories.     
        
**Stopping WOKE in School**     
> By the time Australian students leave school, they will have had more than a decade of being pumped with the narrative that Australia is systemically racist, that the economic, social, and political systems of Western Civilisation are harmful to the planet, and that they must become agents of change as active ‘global citizens’.      
     
**Removing hate speech and discrimination laws**     
> Void the accreditation of any education institution requiring students to undertake mandatory welcome to country pledges, activist Indigenous education modules, and/or radical critical social justice or gender modules.      
> Repeal laws that make it unlawful to offend or insult another person, such as section 18C of the Commonwealth Racial Discrimination Act 1975.      
> Abolish the Australian Human Rights Commission.     
     
**COVID?**   
> Launch a full Royal Commission into the Australian response to Covid-19, including at the State and Federal levels, to get a full accounting of the decisions made during that period and ensure the same mistakes are not repeated.    
      
**Flag law? (getting a bit sovereign citizen here)**     
> End the practice of treating other flags as equal to the Australian flag. Act in accordance with the Flags Act 1953 that declares the Australian flag to be the only Australian National Flag.     
    
Specifically the article lists *""Sixty ideas compiled by IPA staff would help an incoming Federal government restore prosperity and reverse the erosion of our cherished institutions.""* - its introduction is focused on *""removing red tape""* to *""drain the billabong""* (I'm not even joking here, that's what it says). That's right, they're going to stop corruption, by removing all the ""red tape"" barriers to it.         

I'm just writing this to highlight how close we came to becoming an extension of America's MAGA authoritarianism. To highlight that it could indeed happen here, and that some very wealthy and influential politicians, parties, and business people WANT it to not just happen here... but to be more extreme than the American version. They have expressly written, they want an end to Human Rights Organisations, Environmental Protections, and Anti-discrimination laws in Australia.      

I hope this makes everyone realise how close we came, and how much The Liberal Party need to be kept out of office, not just this election - but for many many elections to come.

Remember that Tim Wilson went from working for the IPA, which wants the Human Rights Commission abolished, to be given a $500k salary to head up the HRC by Tony Abbott.
He then entered parliament as a Liberal MP, but not before one of his staff at the HRC, Gillian Triggs, was mercilessly hammered by the Murdoch press and the Morrison government as a part of their culture wars.
Wilson did nothing to support her, nothing.
He's classed as a moderate within the Liberal Party, as is the former Victorian opposition leader John Pesutto who is also a former IPA operative, as well as another IPA alumni in the Victorian senator and China hawk James Paterson.

Yep, Tim Wilson from the liberal party retained his seat and despite being a  prevalent IPA contributor for years.

I always find this argument hilarious because it's being made by people who clearly have no idea how education works. Take the idea that there is a narrative that ""Australia is systemically racist"" -- they never actually cite examples of this. Because if they did have to cite examples, they'd have nothing to work with. Apparently it's racist to recognise that *terra nullius* would have no legal merit in a modern court room.

Parenting,kids off social media,Fostering 8 year old boy with screen addiction. ,"I'm hoping for some advice from parents who adopted/fostered older kids. I'm fostering and going forward with adopting my 8 year old nephew and 8month old niece. 

My nephew has gone through soooo much already in his short life time. His parents were in active addiction and very violent his entire life and they definitely let the iPad raise him. 

He relies so much on screens to regulate his emotions. His ideal set up is to have the TV on, while watching YouTube on a MacBook and playing roblox on a smart phone. 

My gut tells me to completely remove the electronics from him for a few weeks and fully focus on activities offline or outside together. And slowly bring them back as family activities, like playing video games or watching movies together. But all the people in my life tell me that is cruel. 

I've dealt with this as an adult, I had a serious addiction to social media for a few years when I was in college, and the only way I found to actually work, was cutting it out cold turkey. 

I'm being told to wean him off the screens over time, but any move I make in that direction, like setting screen times or limiting it to one screen a day, he becomes extremely stressed because all he can think about is the moment he can get back on them. The only time he isn't stressed is when I turn our wifi off and tell him it's broken and we have to wait for a repair man to fix it. Then he can actually be present in the moment because he knows he can't get back on a screen. 

Should I just follow my gut? I'm thinking a little vacation to start the process would be nice.

He used tv and video games to avoid and process how come he’s in foster care, why he’s so angry, his feelings etc. 

We pulled back on the screen. We started to be in nature, camping, swimming, biking a lot more. Just focused on being an active kid. Sign him up for swim lessons and karate. Sign him up for trampoline. Get him into scouting. Get him into Lego league. Comic book club. Go to the library. 

Do a detox and start with 2 weeks camping where there are literally no screens.  Then just keep him busy with activities. That’s what we did with our kiddo. It was hard at first. It was like breaking an addict.

I see that you’ve posted about this in the past. You’ve been parent to this child for awhile now, and I think you should feel empowered to impose whatever limits you want around screens, to adjust how you’re handling it as time goes on, and to teach this child there’s more to life than screen stimulation. Parenting is a journey where we don’t always have the right answers. The good news is you care!
---
No it's not cruel to deprive someone of TV and video games lol. I say this as a gamer.

Try to keep him in circumstances where the screens aren't available. Outside, on errands with you, activities outside the home. If a vacation is something you can do a nice rustic cabin with no TV would probably really suit!

If you take it away, you need to be actively replacing it with something else.

Wait, a social media platform lying and not living up to expectations? Say it ain't so...

when you hear about 'freedom of speech' these days it's almost always a sign that you are listening to a load of bullshit. Real freedom of speech issues have to do with the Government (NOT restaurants, people, teachers, television shows, businesses, etc etc) and individual citizens. 

When you hear 'freedom of speech' arguments nowadays it is almost always right leaning people complaining that they aren't able to use inappropriate language (typically racial slurs, fat shaming, or 'gay' as a pejorative) without having consequences. People get really confused about the difference between consequences (other people saying 'shut the fuck up loser' for example) and GOVERNMENT making speech illegal. Almost every 'freedom of speech' argument you have heard in your life is a load of shit - the only question is if they are trying to trick you or simply don't understand what they are talking about. 

As for your issue with Tik Tok and 'free speech' - they are blending two different issues for a reason that will be really obvious when you lay them out side by side. They say they are for 'free speech' and they refer to people being able to say whatever they want to in their tik toks. However, the issue with Tik Tok has to do with the ownership of the company and the company's ability to gather mass amounts of information and data on its customers - in this example the customers meaning all americans. 

tik tok wants to present itself as a vehicle of free speech. people who wish to restrict or ban tik tok aren't really discussing the posts of people at all - they are worried about the ability of the government of China to harvest data from all the american tik tok users.

tik tok the big corporation and also everyday people will both make claims about 'free speech' pretty regularly. on tik tok you are getting bothered with censorship because they are a company, not a government, and they automate their content moderation as much as possible. A company censoring you has nothing to do with 'free speech' as a concept - think of it just like how they bleep swear words on television. these filters are hitting you because they want to not pay humans to moderate their app while also ensuring that it is general audience friendly. These goals are based on trying to make the most money possible. 

And to tie everything together - any time you hear an argument about 'free speech' ask yourself whether this is (1) an appeal to a value that everyone thinks is great. It's hard to find people who don't support the concept of 'free speech' - or if it's (2) a person who wishes to speak however they want without consequence. In the case of 2 remember that 'free speech' however defined is about the ability to speak - never about the ability to speak without consequence.

AustralianPolitics,Australia under 16 social media ban,US politicians call for Australia to end greyhound racing — and reap the benefits,"American lawmakers have taken the unusual step of appealing to their Australian counterparts to consider following the US example and banning greyhound racing.

Bernard Keane

Politicians from the United States have written to their Australian counterparts urging them to consider an end to greyhound racing in Australia and detailing how the “sport” is on the verge of ending in the US after years of track closures and animal welfare legislation.

The diverse bipartisan group of more than a dozen politicians from Massachusetts, Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Oregon, New Hampshire, West Virginia and Rhode Island state legislatures took the unusual step of an open letter to urge Australian politicians to consider the experience of the US industry, which has dramatically shrunk in recent years.

At its peak, there were nearly 70 operational dog tracks in 19 states. Today, only two active greyhound racetracks remain, both in West Virginia. They are each owned by hospitality company Delaware North, which has publicly stated its desire to end racing. The company is currently constrained by a state law that mandates greyhound racing as a condition of offering other forms of gambling, and requires that dog racing be subsidized with unrelated gambling revenues.

US legislators have not merely outlawed greyhound racing across dozens of states, they are cutting off revenue for it, with seven American states outlawing remote wagering on dog races, including Australian races. In Washington, there is currently a federal bill in Congress with 80 sponsors to outlaw all gambling on dog racing.



Greyhound overbreeding surges and death toll mounts

The welfare concerns that have driven US legislators to shut down the industry are exactly the same as the ones that plague the Australian industry: in West Virginia, nearly 3,000 greyhound injuries and 50 deaths have occurred since 2020. “American racing dogs also endure lives of severe confinement, and are kept in warehouse-style kennels in rows of stacked metal cages for long hours each day. Drug problems have persisted in the US racing industry, with dogs testing positive for cocaine and other harmful drugs.”

The remaining racing in West Virginia actually seems safer than in Australia: 47 dogs have died racing this year alone in Australia, including 16 in Victoria, and there have been 930 major injuries. In 2024 there were 128 deaths, according to the Coalition for the Protection of Greyhounds. A total of 735 dogs have died racing in Australia since 2021, though this figure does not include off-track deaths, where owners kill dogs injured while racing rather than pay for the veterinary costs necessary for them to recover.

New Zealand has banned greyhound racing effective from July next year. Greyhound racing is now ended in Scotland, though legislators want to ban it permanently. The Welsh government announced in February that racing would be banned as soon as practicable.

The American legislators, led by Massachusetts state Senator Pat Jehlen, point out that US states have used phase-out periods have enable the industry to wind down “in a way that is fair to stakeholders and that also ensures every dog finds a loving home”. There have also been substantial economic benefits from closing greyhound racing racks, with states using closed dog tracks for housing, retailing, music venues, municipal buildings and schools.

It’s the reverse in Australia: state governments continue to subsidise the industry, which is unviable without taxpayer support. The subsidies including funding track “upgrades” that end up killing dogs, and funding large prize money, which in turn encourages owners to race dogs more, increasing the chances of injury and death.

“Greyhounds are gentle dogs, and this is an important issue that deserves considerable legislative attention,” the Americans conclude. Taxpayers might be inclined to agree that this is one American political example we should follow.",96,71,CommonwealthGrant,https://www.crikey.com.au/2025/05/19/greyhound-racing-us-politics-urge-australia-end/,2025-05-19 04:30:43,"**Greetings humans.**

The thing i dont get about the people who want to keep greyhound racing is that the people who gamble on it dont care what they are gambling on, they will bet on anything. You could run cockroach races and people would bet on them. Theres just no need for the dogs to be involved and lots of reasons for them not to be given the long history of mistreatment by the industry.

Greyhound racing is a cruel rort, and everyone knows it.
But our politicians are pretty much owned by the gambling industry, so I feel that nothing will happen. 
I mean, Cranbourne dog track just reopened. And despite a majority of Australians across the voting divide hate gambling advertising, but the government won't even do anything to reduce it. 

There's just too much money involved, and both parties don't have the guts to do anything about it.
---
Can we also acknowledge that all these issues exist in thoroughbred horse racing as well? We’re also going to ban that, right?
---
Yep, let's ban it already.  We can use the US, NZ, Scottish, and Welsh examples as good precedents.

And please, let's not get shirty about acknowledging that greyhound racing is one area where USA policy is better than AUS.  Gambling more generally is another major flaw in our policy.

It also works the other way, with our health care and guns policies being better in AUS than the USA.

I haven't seen anyone in real life or online be ok about it, but I noticed the most vocal opponents who are calling it a slippery slope into losing freedoms of speech tend to be people I would never agree on much with, and that is making me question my own opinion/ thoughts. 

I also don't think it'll protect kids when they still have access to the chat feature in games and other places, Snapchat has managed to be excluded because it's a messaging service, so it seems like they'll just move to less regulated sites like 4chan  instead of twitter.

It’s BS! Nothing to do with protecting children

""To protect the children"" is the go to when politicians want to create laws that they know will be (rightly) unpopular. After all, anyone who doesn't want to ""protect the children"" must automatically be a bad person who shouldn't be listened to, right?

It is Orwellian. It is surveillance creep. It's an invasion of privacy. It is a slippery slope for freedom of speech. I am center left, for reference. Not someone with extreme political views. I just care about privacy. I even support opt-in digital identity, as it has potential to improve privacy in many ways. I do not support mandatory 'age assurance' or whatever they are trying to whitewash age verification and identity checks as. We should be concerned about this.

It's not evidence based. It's never been implemented successfully anywhere. It doesn't teach children how to use the internet safely or report problematic behaviour. It doesn't keep social media platforms accountable for regulating and moderating harmful content (which can be harmful for adults, too). When has banning anything worked? We've done such a great job with vapes, drugs and alcohol ... /s

I am generally optimistic about the future, but this kind of legislation makes me worried about the direction we are heading as a nation. More than anything else happening at the moment. Cost of living, yeah whatever the whole world sucks right now and Australia isn't alone there - there are economic cycles and we're in a downturn.  This however, was not something anyone asked for. It sets a very worrying precedent. I have voted Labor my entire life and this alone has me reconsidering it. It's an unintelligent response to a complex problem, pandering to and fearmongering parents who can't teach their own children to use the internet safely.

AustralianPolitics,Online Safety Commissioner Australia,Albanese and Dutton’s love-fest for the teen social media ban is a craven embarrassment,"Both leaders say they want to be tough on big tech and to help kids. From what we know about the teen social media ban, it might accomplish neither aim.

Cam Wilson



During this week’s federal election leaders debate, there was a truly embarrassing moment.

When Anthony Albanese was asked about his government’s teen social media ban, the prime minister said he “wouldn’t budge” against “major pressure” by some of the social media giants, Reuters reported.

Similarly, Peter Dutton agreed that “we have worked really hard to hold these companies to account.” 

Even in a world where we expect politicians to spin and lie, this performative, bipartisan, “tough on big tech” schtick, espoused by the two men vying to be our next prime minister, was comical.

If anything, the Online Safety Act (Social Media Minimum Age), supported by both major parties, shows exactly how big corporate interests get their way if politicians think it aligns with a cheap and easy win.

That’s because all the evidence points to one of the biggest foreign-owned companies in the world — which, by the way, pays a fraction of the tax you’d expect — being given an inexplicable “sweetheart deal”. 

For months, the government’s decision to exempt Google’s YouTube from the teen social media ban has puzzled observers and irked (to put it lightly) its competitors.

This is Australia’s attempt to stop teens from being exposed to extreme content, algorithms and from wasting their time on digital devices. And YouTube — home to extreme content, powerful recommendation systems, and a service that Australians spend more average time on than anything else — is being given its own carveout.

The government defended this decision, saying YouTube had educational and informational uses. This rationale was professional grade, pure bullshit: other platforms like TikTok are filled with educational and informational videos and, regardless, the social media ban law has been written in a way that means people of all ages could still watch that content (because the ban is only really on people having accounts). Despite this, the Coalition has supported the government’s implementation, including the YouTube exemption. 

In the months since, we’ve gotten more information that casts this bizarre decision in an even dimmer light. 

Great reporting by The Australian Financial Review and Guardian Australia reveals that YouTube’s CEO personally lobbied Communications Minister Michelle Rowland for an exemption, and that Rowland personally promised that the company would get one — despite the fact the government was promising a policy process that would work out all the other details of implementation.

It’s the cherry on top of an already farcical policy process, which included:

* The prime minister’s captain pick to ban teens long before it was considered by his party, let alone before a careful evaluation of the policy or its implementation by his government. 
* The decision to pass a law and figure out the details of the ban later — crucially, after the next election. 
* The communications minister arguing for the ban by citing a study that did not justify the ban, according to its own co-author.
* A Utopia-esque document prepared by the Communications Department, citing the above study, erroneous calculations, and the use of bizarre matrices to justify the legislation.
* The decision to bypass the normal review of the impacts of a law and instead rely on a post-implementation review to pick up any unforeseen impacts.
* The government’s snap inquiry — which received 15,000 submissions in just over a day — which waved through the legislation after just three business days, after the government’s previous inquiry failed to support the ban.
* The policy decision to only regulate social media accounts, leaving kids free to use TikTok and other platforms so long as they don’t log in.
* The last-minute decision to arbitrarily choose 16 as the age cut-off, after the minister’s own talking points admitting there was “no robust evidence to support a definitive answer on a single age”. 
* A report on potential implementation of the teen social media ban, set to be handed to the government before the end of the month, but not to be released publicly, so that voters could know before the election. 

It beggars belief just how ham-fisted the government has been in developing this policy. And that’s not even mentioning the actual merit of the policy, which is, to put it lightly, contested. 

It’s one thing for Albanese to smash through a policy — or should I say, the framework of a policy, given how little is actually worked out — that is politically expedient for him. Labor deserves the brunt of the criticism over this. But blame should also be apportioned to the Coalition, which is proudly on a “unity ticket” with Labor on this issue. 

Peter Dutton called for a teen social media ban before Albanese. So why has he signed up for such a broken version of it? Why accept a policy that is, on its face, actually giving preferential treatment to the biggest of big tech companies? Why let your opposition run roughshod over Parliament with bad policy? 

(By the way, the fact that major media companies and groups that campaigned for the teen social media ban are all happy with an ineffectual, flawed version of this law without much complaint is incredibly revealing. Perhaps I shouldn’t be surprised that the same groups that ignored the nuanced scholarship on teens and social media harm are also happy to ignore the obvious flaws in the implementation of a ban that leaves children exposed to the very things that it’s supposed to protect them from. A cynical person might think that some would rather do something that looks like they’re helping kids rather than doing the work of figuring out what actually will.) 

This election, there’s been a lot of agreement between Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton. They’ve matched each other’s spending promises and promised similar solutions to problems. In some cases, this can be a good thing. After all, why make fights? There’s a benefit in working together for the good of the nation.

Embarrassingly though, the major parties are proudly working together to avoid hard questions about the teen social media ban. And Australia, and its children, are worse off for it.",94,125,CommonwealthGrant,https://www.crikey.com.au/2025/04/24/albanese-dutton-teen-social-media-ban-youtube/,2025-04-25 00:52:34,"**Greetings humans.**

I understand something needs to be done about radicalisation and the other problems of social media but a ban will accomplish nothing and doesn’t really address the problem which is largely media literacy 

You really wanna improve things put in the curriculum as soon as kids are using laptops and and tablets in class every term they have to a media literacy course. Continue that until university and that would be more productive than a ban

Save the kids.

Do something dead easy and effective like ban gambling ads and attempt to roll back the gambling culture of Australia that sucks kids in early?

As someone in tech I didn't like the policy at first, but I think the government's explanation is pretty good. It's like under age drinking it's not going to be prevented fully but at least it makes it easier for parents to point to the government for why a kid can't do something.

AustralianPolitics,young people and social media ban,Cheaper arts degrees after Labor ‘unscrambles’ uni fees,"The Albanese government will roll back the failed Morrison government policy that increased fees for arts and humanities degrees, as part of a suite of measures to lower student debt.

Health Minister Mark Butler confirmed his colleague, Education Minister Jason Clare, was working on the changes as part of his response to the Australian Universities Accord, a 12-month review of the higher education system.

“He’s made clear that he would like to be able to say something towards the end of the year about some of the recommendations around the structure of university fees, which was obviously changed significantly by the former government,” Mr Butler said.

Sources familiar with the policy process said the government was looking to “unscramble” the Morrison government’s Job-ready Graduates scheme, which lowered fees in areas of need but increased them in the arts and humanities by up to 117 per cent, with no meaningful change in behaviour.

For example, the annual cost of a social studies or communications degree rose from $6684 in 2020 to $14,500 in 2021, while the annual fee for a law, commerce or economics degree increased from $11,155 to $14,500.

Conversely, the annual fee for a maths or science degree fell from $9527 to $3950, nursing and teaching degrees dropped from $6684 to $3950 and an engineering degree fell from $9527 to $7950.

Other recommendations receiving close attention from the government include having an independent body, an Australian Tertiary Education Commission, set course fees, increasing income support and legislating to require employers to deduct HELP debt repayments from each pay packet, rather than at the end of each financial year, which reduces the impact of indexation.

These changes will have a permanent impact on lowering the cost of education, in contrast to the $16 billion cut announced at the weekend that will apply only to debts that exist on June 1, 2025.

The $16 billion debt forgiveness takes the so-called off-budget spending accrued by this government to almost $70 billion. It will cost the budget $600 million in extra interest payments over the next four years, and grow beyond that.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese ensured the reduction would be front and centre during the election campaign by pledging the requisite legislation would be the first cab off the rank if Labor won a second term.

“The first thing we will do if we are re-elected, is we will introduce legislation,” he told parliament.

While the measure is aimed primarily at students and young graduates who may be tempted to vote for the Greens, the legislation timetable is also about trying to wedge the Coalition against both Labor and the teal independents.

However, the opposition said it would oppose the measure, claiming it to be cynical opportunism.

It argued the government exacerbated the student debt problem by presiding over sustained high inflation, to which repayments are indexed.

Opposition Leader Peter Dutton told parliament the prime minister was copying Queensland Labor leader Steven Miles who engaged in a spending spree in the run-up to the October 26 state election, at which he lost government.

“Mr Miles was willing to sacrifice state finances to try to make people like him again. The prime minister played this trick on the weekend,” Mr Dutton said.

“Our country is off track and this Labor government is damaging the economy and keeping interest rates higher for longer, which is hurting families. When will the reckless spending stop?”

Greens leader Adam Bandt, who wants all student debt abolished, demanded the prime minister pass the legislation now, and not make it an election issue.

Mr Albanese noted there was already a backlog of government legislation the Greens were refusing to pass, including two housing bills.

“Even when things are their policy, they say they are not voting for it,” he said.

With just two Senate sitting weeks left this year, Mr Albanese said the priority was to pass the aged care reforms. In a Senate inquiry report released on Monday, the Coalition said it would support the financial changes, which require those with the means, to pay more, but was still demanding the release of the regulations before giving a nod to the entire bill.",88,141,Throwawaydeathgrips,https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/government-planning-permanent-measures-to-ease-student-debt-20241104-p5knlf,2024-11-05 06:28:58,"**Greetings humans.**

As someone who has worked on the teaching side of STEM uni degrees - What actually matters is government funding.

The Coalition, in what was either idiocy or malice, used their reforms as a way to **cut university funding**.

>Conversely, the annual fee for a maths or science degree fell from $9527 to $3950

I'll tell you now - they did **not** pick up the full bill for this sudden drop in fees. Students doing a STEM degree now, the kind of degree which the Coalition *claims* to want to support, are getting a **worse education** due to less funding for teaching staff & materials. Due to universities being forced to receive lower fees from students, without government covering the loss.

Similarly if Albo wants to do his own reshuffle of fees that's fine - but I hope that it won't be yet another government smokescreen to hide uni funding once again being reduced.
---
Good policy. I do think Adam has a point although it’s understandable why Albo would want to make it an election issue- just pass it now.

A law or other 5-6 year degree graduate should not be more than $50k in the hole. HECS is a social compact where taxpayers promise a leg up, and the student promises to put in a little over the life of their career. I’ve never understood the people who think it’s somehow unfair that the non uni goers pay for those who do- yeah, of course. I pay for your doctor’s appointments and your kid’s public schooling, it’s give and take.

Also I’ve paid off my HECS long ago so I don’t have skin in this game

How often do you hear people ragging on Australian cinema, music or fashion? If you see no value in arts and humanities, unsubscribe from Netflix, burn your history books, delete Spotify, close the cinema, don’t mention that doco you’ve been frothing, live in a white metal shell of a home and don’t complain about Australian having no culture. 

It’s this lack of funding that is contributing to us having no understanding of ourselves and our lack of passion for Australian research and artistic pursuits. The quality is dropping and these endeavors are now being reserved for the rich and privileged.

And don’t start me on how little the arts contributes to society from a monetary perspective. The music industry alone contributes $4-6bil a year. 

I’d gladly pay for a diversely educated society than one that’s sole purpose is to pump out lawyers and accountants.

AustralianPolitics,Albanese social media ban,Election 2025: How can you tell you’re in a teal seat? Peter Dutton is nowhere to be seen,"**How can you tell you’re in a teal seat? Dutton is nowhere to be seen**

**David Crowe, Chief political correspondent, April 25, 2025 — 5.00am**

Liberal loyalists are adamant that Peter Dutton has been visiting teal seats in the run-up to the election to reclaim the prized territory that helped their party hold power for decades. But the opposition leader’s flightpath over the past few weeks tells a very different story, because there is no doubt he is avoiding the leafy seats where voters [put the Liberals in the doghouse](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/inside-the-teal-wave-how-the-independent-revolution-happened-20220522-p5ani0.html) three years ago.

The independent MPs who won these seats – let’s call them the teals, even though they have different colours and characters – are being targeted by vigorous Liberal campaigns to paint them as proxies for Labor or the Greens. But there is a missing element in these local campaigns: the man who aspires to be prime minister.

Dutton is absent for good reason. Liberals admit that he will drag down the vote for a Liberal candidate in a teal seat if he turns up at a polling station. “It would not be doing them any favours to be seen campaigning with him,” says one. The Liberal campaign admits this every day by sending the leader to regional and outer-suburban Australia, well away from those blue-ribbon seats.

On Tuesday, for instance, he was in the NSW town of Orange to help the Nationals win the regional seat of Calare. Ten days ago, he was in the Macedon Ranges in Victoria to try to win the seat of McEwen. But he has not held an event in the Melbourne seats of Kooyong or Goldstein since the campaign began, nor held one in the Sydney seats of Mackellar, Warringah or Wentworth.

It is not that he has never been to a teal seat: he clearly has, and he has had a full term of parliament to do so. But he is keeping his distance during the campaign, when voters are paying more attention.

This is helping the teal candidates because 45 per cent of voters name Dutton as the top reason for being hesitant about voting Liberal – a key [finding](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lst0) in the Resolve Political Monitor this week. Only 24 per cent name Anthony Albanese as a concern in voting Labor. It is now very clear that Dutton is a drag on the Liberal vote.

It has been left for others to come to the aid of the Liberal candidates, most of them women. The Liberal deputy, Sussan Ley, is figuring in social media posts for several of the candidates, while health spokeswoman Anne Ruston and finance spokeswoman Jane Hume are also visiting. Dutton is absent from the social posts.

Liberals will not talk on the record about this problem in the middle of the campaign, but they clearly need more high-profile women in positions of power to help them win back these seats – and save the ones they hold. In Bradfield, a Liberal seat on Sydney’s north shore, Liberal candidate Gisele Kapterian is up against Nicolette Boele, a teal backed by Climate 200. The star appearance in Kapterian’s social media last weekend was not a federal Liberal leader; it was Gladys Berejiklian, the former NSW premier.

This is a danger sign for the Liberals if the polls are right and Albanese stays in office, whether in majority or minority government. Dutton has made no secret of the fact that he believes victory lies with the “battlers” in the outer suburbs, but there is no path to power without success in at least some of the teal seats. So Dutton looks too aloof to talk to the voters he needs. Can a Liberal leader who cannot visit a teal seat remain a Liberal leader?

The campaign against the teals has relied heavily on personal attacks. In Bradfield, again, the Liberals have a truck-mounted billboard that circles the railway stations and polling booths to remind voters that Boele once made an [off-colour remark](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lo3m) at the hairdresser. Every candidate is accountable for what they’ve done or said, and it is no different for the teals.

What is missing is a value proposition to convince the teal voters to return to the Liberals. The teal message at the last election was about climate change, integrity in government and empowering women. This year, the Liberal flyers in the same electorates are about a strong economy, cheaper energy, affordable homes, safer communities and quality healthcare. There is nothing customised for a woman who likes [Boele’s message about “saying no to party politics”](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/nsw/this-electorate-is-one-of-sydney-s-most-affluent-it-is-not-immune-to-cost-of-living-pressures-20250408-p5lq2k.html) and getting action on climate.

One Liberal is privately worried about Team Dutton’s offer to the teal voters: “There’s nothing. They didn’t even try.” It is worth noting that the frustration over the economy might work for Dutton in these seats just as it works in others.

“The anger we saw towards us at the last election is certainly not there,” says one Liberal familiar with the teal campaigns. Dutton may not be hugely popular, but this is nothing compared to the [anger at Scott Morrison](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/how-morrison-turns-the-blue-heartland-teal-20220505-p5aiyz.html) as prime minister three years ago. A second difference, he says, is that Liberal supporters were too complacent about the threat in 2022 and are alive to that mistake in 2025.

There is another shift this time: the Liberals have been smarter in choosing candidates. More than half are women, many have backgrounds in business and most are socially liberal. None is like [Katherine Deves](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/from-internet-activist-to-chosen-candidate-who-is-katherine-deves-20220422-p5afbr.html), who spoke out against transgender rights as the candidate for Warringah at the last election – and suffered a 5.7 per cent fall in the Liberal primary vote.

Anything can happen in the final week of a campaign. Dutton outplayed Albanese on the Voice referendum and may do so again on May 3. So far, however, the opposition leader has run a very ordinary campaign. In week one, he sounded too ready to move into [Kirribilli House](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lnvm). In week two, he had to [retreat on working from home](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lpkg). Then he verballed the [Indonesian president](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5ls7g). In week four, he sounded confused about cutting [$3 billion in tax breaks](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5ls7g) for electric vehicles. No week has gone clearly his way.

Albanese has been more disciplined. He fell off a stage in the first week, and finally admitted it in the fourth week, but he has been steady on policy. Dutton, in contrast, has slipped on a series of policy banana peels, raising real questions about whether he and his team have done the work required to govern.

Dutton’s absence from the teal seats will be remembered if the Coalition falls short of victory. Could he be doing more to win back those teal voters? Could he bring himself to tell them he wants their support? That would mean taking a few steps toward them, rather than expecting them to rush back to him. There’s an old saying for this: “History is made by those who show up.”",87,43,Enthingification,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/how-can-you-tell-you-re-in-a-teal-seat-dutton-is-nowhere-to-be-seen-20250424-p5ltxf.html,2025-04-25 00:51:30,"**Greetings humans.**

AustralianPolitics,Australia under 16 social media ban,Scott Yung under spotlight in Bennelong amid Liberal Party concern,"Earlier this month, senior Liberal MPs began receiving frantic calls from the party’s state director, Chris Stone. The administrator was desperately trying to figure out who was behind a series of damaging stories about Bennelong candidate Scott Yung.

The scars of the internecine factional warring that engulfed the NSW Liberal Party in the lead-up to the 2022 election are still raw. The party was more recently subject to a federal takeover. But senior Liberal sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity to disclose private matters, said Stone’s worried calls were telling for another reason.

Contesting the most marginal seat in Australia, one where Yung is considered the favourite by bookmakers, the risk was not simply losing a must-win electorate but the fear there was something more waiting in the shadows that could potentially derail the Liberal campaign.

Hushed conversations were also taking place among senior Liberals about Yung during budget week in Canberra. The tenor was the same.

Stone was likely aware of something many of those MPs were not. An email from an “Australian Citizen” to the Labor and Liberal HQs on February 25 – just eight days before the Herald’s first story – levelled four allegations against Yung and said they had “serious concerns” about his candidacy.

“The integrity of the party and its members is paramount. Choosing the right candidates to represent Australia is far more important than simply securing a seat. Should these issues come to light in the public domain, it could severely harm the party’s reputation and future prospects,” the email read.

The allegations were light on detail and unsupported by evidence, so easily could have been dismissed as another unsubstantiated dirt file circulated in the shadow of a federal election campaign. Labor HQ tried reaching out to the author of the email to no avail, Sussex Street sources said.

But the mysterious correspondence proved prescient.On March 5, Yung admitted to falsely claiming he had raised $60,000 during an intimate dinner with John Howard ahead of the 2019 state election. He did not specify how much was actually raised. Then revelations came out that the then-Kogarah candidate engaged a digital strategy firm to undertake work potentially worth tens of thousands of dollars.

One month later, a leaked video of a speech Yung gave during a Lunar New Year celebration discredited previous efforts to distance himself from Xie Xiongming, a casino high roller linked to the Chinese Communist Party.

In a statement responding to questions about Xie and his remarks in the video, Yung said he was invited to speak and “as is standard practice, I acknowledged those present in the room with culturally appropriate honorifics”.

Two of the allegations contained in the February 25 email went to these stories. One bullet point was titled “Unclear Funding Sources in Elections”, while another raised potential conflicts of interest “regarding Scott’s connections to China and their impact on Australian interests”.

The Herald has chosen not to disclose the other two unsubstantiated allegations.

Liberal heartland?

Bennelong was always going to be a bellwether seat for the Coalition’s prospects at the May 3 election. The Australian Electoral Commission’s redistribution left Bennelong – the suburban seat of former Liberal prime minister John Howard – notionally Liberal, with a buffer of just 0.04 per cent.

Bennelong was a Liberal heartland. But 15 years after former ABC journalist Maxine McKew dethroned Howard, voters across Ryde, Meadowbank and Eastwood dramatically walked away from the Liberal Party to deliver Labor a stunning victory, only the second time the party has held the seat in 53 years.

If Labor MP Jerome Laxale manages to hold on, the Coalition faces a long night.

Yung, who has been a member of the party since meeting NSW Liberal frontbencher Mark Coure in 2016, divides opinion in the notoriously tribal party.

Some see the multilingual son of parents from Shanghai and Hong Kong as the party’s future: an articulate young man who can appeal to a diaspora once turned off by Morrison’s hawkish rhetoric about China.

Liberal insiders talk about Yung’s capacity to reach into the Chinese diaspora to organise volunteers with little notice and fundraise well beyond his stature given he holds no public office. The magnetism of Yung has captured senior Liberals, including leader Peter Dutton, who offered him an endorsement for his preselection.

Two $1500 per head “private dinners” were planned with Yung: one was held on April 8 with Senator Anne Ruston; the other scheduled for April 24 with former prime minister Tony Abbott was later cancelled with no explanation. But they show the fundraising pull Yung can muster, some sources say.

A Liberal spokesman did not explain why the Le Montage fundraiser was cancelled but said Yung and Abbott “will be attending a community event in the electorate on that night instead”.

Some point to the Liberal Party Chinese Youth Council as evidence of his fundraising ability. Established by Yung, the official launch at Doltone House in July 2018 was a spectacular success, pulling anywhere from 800 to 1000 attendees, according to estimates on social media. The cheapest seats went for $99 each, while platinum tables cost $4500.

Yung sat at the head table between then-premier Gladys Berejiklian and then-federal North Sydney MP Trent Zimmerman.

Yung spruiks a tale of typical Liberal aspiration: born into a Waterloo housing commission, climbed his way through Mark Bouris’ Yellow Brick Road mortgage brokers to become head of recruitment, joining the Liberal Party along the way.

Then there’s the now legendary story of how the then little-known Yung came within 1500 votes of toppling Labor MP Chris Minns. With little funding and the electorate not on Liberal HQ’s radar until late in the campaign, Yung pulled off a 5.1 per cent two-party-preferred swing.

But others in the party are less convinced by the Yung lore.

“He’s a used car salesman,” says one senior Liberal speaking on the condition of anonymity. “All flash and no substance”.

There’s the facade of Yung, then there’s the reality, a Liberal powerbroker says.

The Liberal Party Chinese Youth Council event at Doltone House is underscored by Liberal MPs as having major question marks. There is only $57,010 in donations disclosed to the NSW Electoral Commission for the event. Divided by the 797 attendees, the number Yung claims attended in his nomination candidate form, equates to about $70 per head – hardly enough to cover the catering.

Even taking the most conservative estimates, 797 people buying the cheapest $99 tickets equates to $78,903 — nearly $22,000 more than what has been disclosed. The party’s disclosures only list 26 donations across 20 separate donors, just a fraction of the event’s attendees. Yung and his mother account for $8180 of the associated donations, or more than 14 per cent, according to disclosures with the Electoral Commission.

A Liberal Party spokesman said: “The Liberal Party Chinese Youth Council continues to be a group within the division. The ticketed event that you’re referring to was funded by ticket sales and the division.”

The Herald has, on multiple occasions, attempted to ask Yung about this in person. First, at the Bennelong campaign launch at the Ryde-Eastwood RSL on April 5 (Yung was snuck in and out of the venue). Then, he declined to answer questions at a candidate forum in Macquarie Park two days later.

“I’ve given everything I’ve just shared to you, and I just got nothing more to add,” he said.

Yung was contacted by the Herald again for this story.

When Sky News host Laura Jayes asked at the end of March whether there were any other “skeletons in your closet” after the Herald’s story about his fundraising mishap and other matters, Yung did not respond directly. “If that’s the best that the other side has. What I’m focused on is ensuring that we bring back strong economic management to bring down the cost of living,” he said.

Pressed on whether he had been “upfront and honest”, Yung replied: “100 per cent.”

Even the Kogarah run, the crown jewel of the Yung mythology, is marked by infighting.

Correspondence obtained by the Herald between Yung’s campaign team just two days before the state election shows serious concerns about a series of videos posted on the candidate’s social media profiles seemingly without the necessary political authorisation.

“I have hidden every video I couldn’t edit to add the authorisation,” wrote Yung’s campaign manager.

“Now I just hope Labor hasn’t screenshot \[sic\] any of these posts. Because I sure would have, and I’d be walking it up to the returning officer or taking it to the papers.”

An associate of Yung’s named Andy Wong then directs a barrage of abuse at the campaign manager, saying, “Stop f--king complaining like a girl. All talk, no action … if you want to quit F--ken quit. Don’t chuck this bluffing shit.”

Yung’s campaign manager replies: “I’m taking my credit card off the account, restoring scott as admin, then leaving as an admin.”

Yung’s voice is absent from the chat. Breaking electoral material laws during the election campaign period can be a criminal offence. The Herald is not suggesting Yung broke these laws, just that there are questions to be answered as a result of the leaked correspondence, some of which is detailed below.

Yung was contacted by the Herald for comment.

Two years later, explaining his success during the Kogarah campaign, Yung claimed to have doorknocked the electorate of 40,000 homes “one and a half times”. Over a six-week campaign, this would have involved Yung and a team of seven visiting 200 homes every day.

“Absolute bullshit,” one Liberal MP suggested.

This feat seems less feasible given a Chinese language advertorial paid for by Yung’s team boasted the candidate would spend “one or two days every week making ‘nuisance calls’,” saying at maximum they “made more than 100 calls a day”.

In his endorsement of Yung, Dutton said: “Scott had demonstrated his strength as a Liberal Party candidate and skill as a campaigner”, noting the “more than 200,000 followers on social media” he gained in eight weeks.

But Yung has nowhere near 200,000 followers. Six years after the campaign, his public profiles have about 3800 on Instagram and 1200 on Facebook. WeChat, the Chinese social media platform, doesn’t disclose followers of public profiles, but his most popular post only has 13,000 views.

Despite the question marks, one only has to drive through Ryde to see Yung has a serious chance of claiming Bennelong. His corflutes have sprung up across front lawns and walls right through suburbs that rejected the Liberal Party in 2022.

With each day closer to polling day, Yung’s two worlds, facade and legend, have converged. The result on May 3 could determine which he is remembered by.",85,38,patslogcabindigest,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/frantic-calls-party-concern-as-lib-candidate-under-spotlight-20250409-p5lqkx.html,2025-04-15 02:04:32,"**Greetings humans.**

The me the key take away is he is not a local, he is a Liberal.

He won't represent the local community, Bennelong.  He is not from Bennelong, and has no deep connection to the region.

The people of Bennelong are well educated.  They know climate change is real.

As a Liberal he will represent the interests fossil fuel industry.  They are attempting to prevent timely action on climate change.  Without timely action we will destroy the climate that civilisation has always depended on.

Parenting,age verification social media Australia,Friend's Smarphones at our home... how to better handle it. ,"(reposting without the links to book and without the link to an NPR Article as to not violate ""No linking, promotion, or advertising"" rule. This is not spam. I am a parent with a genuine situation looking for advice)

We have 9 and 11 year old daughters. Neither have phones. They play outside often. Their neighborhood friends are here several times per week and their friends are starting to bring smart phones. They are all good kids.

My wife and I have decided to wait until 8th grade to give ours phones.

Last week when their friends were over. I told their friends to put their smartphones in the kitchen while they went out to swim, hang out and play in the front yard. Friends age range 9 to 12.

One parent was a bit upset that I took away their kids phone and that the kid needed a way to contact her in case of emergency at all times etc.

What can I say to their friend's parents about smartphones at our home. I would like to find a middle ground like they can call or text their parents any time, but they can not hold their phones the whole time they are here.

I would like all the kids to socialize without smartphones in between them.

Update: Some of the kids last year had the watches that had gps, text and call. Those were never an issue as the kids where not on screen per say or on social media. We never said then for them to put the watches in the kitchen.

Also, we have known the parents from the neighborhood for 4 to 7 years. We are not strangers.

I think you need to work this out with the individual parents. Everyone will feel differently about this.
---
My daughter is younger and won’t have a phone for a long time, but one of the reasons we’ll eventually be getting her a phone is so that she can let me know if she ever feels uncomfortable or unsafe. I know a lot of parents have code words or other systems set up where their kids can give them a signal then the parent can be the bad guy and say they have to go home. Your system prevents this and could take away a kid’s ‘out’ if they’re feeling peer pressure to do something they’re not comfortable with.
---
I would never take away another kid's phone. I understand worrying about screentime, but that is their lifeline to their parents. If they want to leave or feel uncomfortable they don't need an extra barrier. It's not my job to police someone else's kid. My daughters don't have phones yet. Some of their friends do. It's hasn't been a problem at all. The only issue we had was that a friend texted that she was in trouble, but it was a prank. That wasn't their fault, they came to me as soon as they got the text and I helped sort it out. It made me trust them with their phones even more because they showed good judgement.

privacy,Online Safety Amendment Act 2024,US Gov't wants invasive know-your-customer regulations for cloud providers,"The U.S. Department of Commerce is pushing to require the IaaS industry (infrastructure as a service, ex: AWS and other virtual machine hosts) to verify customer identities with bank-grade KYC:  

> The proposed rule would institute a CIP requirement for U.S. IaaS providers akin to the “know your customer” requirements applicable to banks, introducing a complex compliance protocol that will require resources and lead time.

( That's from the [summary at NatLawReview](https://natlawreview.com/article/us-department-commerce-publishes-proposed-rule-imposing-know-your-customer-and), worth reading )

From the rule text, this would affect:

> any product or service offered to a consumer, including complimentary or “trial” offerings, that provides processing, storage, networks, or other fundamental computing resources, and with which the consumer is able to deploy and run software that is not predefined, including operating systems and applications

So basically any host offering virtual machines, dedicated machines, code platform as a service, etc would need to collect and verify identity information.

The information to be required includes name, address, phone number, etc.  The rule doesn't prevent companies from using that KYC information for marketing or resale purposes.

The rule, though targeted at non-US customers, would also require US customers to comply:

> The proposed rule seems to suggest that providers should assume all potential customers and beneficial owners are non-U.S. persons until the aforementioned identifying information is collected and assessed.

Customers outside US, or customers the provider thinks are suspicious, may require additional documentation (such as driver license scans, etc.)

This would cause regulatory burden for companies offering cloud hosting to comply with, and impact any customers who wants to use US hosting anonymously.  With the verification, it would be very difficult to use an anonymous identity with US cloud providers.  

The new regulations would be backed by the full force of law, and failure to comply could result in civil & criminal penalties.

**__My Thoughts__**

It is unlikely, in my opinion, that invasive KYC verification would actually do much to thwart cyber-crime.  Bad actors could just host outside the US, or buy a stolen identity for cheap on the dark web.  Meanwhile, the vast majority of good customers are penalized with having to fork over personal information which may just get leaked or intentionally sold.  (If you've ever gotten your e-mail or phone number sold to one of those business spam lists, you know it's basically impossible to get off them).

They are requiring bank-grade KYC, but not providing even the bare minimum of bank-grade privacy protections.  (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act is not much, but it is at least something.)

Personally, I use a gov't ACP address & pen name due to some past personal safety issues in my life and I don't give out my home address to companies anymore.  It is usually a fight with companies that do KYC to get them to accept my public-facing addresses because their systems are often coded to reject PO Boxes and CMRA's.  KYC makes it hard to protect myself, so I hate seeing other branches of the gov't pushing for it.

AustralianPolitics,social media age restriction Australia,Greens candidate reportedly posted he wanted to 'f---ing kill politicians',"An ACT Greens candidate reportedly posted on social media that he wanted politicians to be hanged.

James Cruz, who is running in Kurrajong, posted on social media he wanted to “f—ing kill politicians” and “send them to The Hague and hang them in the street” over their treatment of asylum seekers, The Australian hasreported.

The newspaper also reported that Mr Cruz said he did not “give a shit” about Israeli forces dying “when they couldn’t care less about indiscriminately slaughtering civilians and actively cheer as they die”.

A Greens spokesman told The Australian the posts related to issues of concern for the party, including violence against civilians, corporate accountability. drug harm reduction and people seeking asylum but that Mr Cruz disavowed violence.

“The tone of the posts is impassioned and will be confronting to some, as are the issues themselves. Mr Cruz disavows violence and made those comments over deep pain at deaths of innocent civilians and the treatment of the refugee community, of which he has family and friends,” the spokesman said.

Mr Cruz has previously run as an ACT Greens Senate candidate. A candidate profile said he moved to Canberra from Sydney in 2020 and works as a librarian at the National Library of Australia.

He has been a member of the Greens since 2011 and said he was drawn to the party for its housing policies.

“Growing up in poverty and living in public housing showed me the urgent need for a society that addresses inequality and the growing housing crisis,” Mr Cruz’s profile said.

The Canberra Liberals have blasted the Greens over Mr Cruz’s posts.

“These comments are abhorrent and have no place in ACT politics,” a Liberals spokesman said.

“Shane Rattenbury needs to come out publicly and tell Canberrans if these views are shared by the party and if he knew about the before the candidate was preselected.”

Last week the Greens defended blog posts written by Harini Rangarajan, which compared Osama bin Laden with Jesus Christ.

The party said it was “creative writing” and did not reflect the 20-year-old’s personal views.

Greens leader Shane Rattenbury acknowledged the material could be concerning and confronting for the community but said Ms Rangarajan would continue to be a candidate for the Greens and had been clear it was not her personal views.

However the Greens leader acknowledged the party had not been aware of the specific material in the posts, despite the blog account being disclosed as part of the candidate vetting process late last year. That process would be reviewed after the election, he said.

This ACT election is really turning out some great info on some of the candidates the local Greens are putting forward.

AustralianPolitics,age verification social media Australia,Who’s backing who? Every major newspaper’s pick for prime minister,"Calum Jaspan
May 2, 2025 — 7.00pm

It’s tradition for Australia’s biggest newspapers to endorse a party in print and online editorials the day before Australians head to the polls.

On Friday, a slim majority, led by News Corp’s mastheads, went against the expectations of pollsters and backed the Coalition to gain power on Saturday evening.

Below are the positions Australia’s biggest publishers have taken on the 2025 federal election.

Nine Newspapers

The Sydney Morning Herald (Nine): An Albanese-led Labor government

“Ultimately, the Herald believes Dutton has not done enough to tell us who he is, what he believes in and what sort of leader he would be. We are not convinced he is ready to be prime minister, and do not believe the Coalition is fit to return to office after just three years in opposition.

While the Herald believes Albanese and Labor are the best option to form government, we do so with qualifications. The government has been competent but lacked ideas, reforming zeal and at times dithered in the crouch position as the world crashes around us.”

Past endorsements: 2010 (Gillard), 2013 (Abbott), 2016 (Turnbull), 2019 (Shorten), and 2022 (Albanese).

The Age (Nine): An Albanese-led Labor government

“The Albanese government has had only three years in government. Despite its failures and missed opportunities it has not been so terrible that it deserves to be the first government thrown out after one term in almost 100 years.

In his profile of Australia’s 31st prime minister, Chip Le Grand described Albanese as staid and predictable. The same could be said of Albanese’s government. Perhaps at this point in time, and given the choices at the nation’s disposal, that is the best option available to the country.”

Past endorsements: 2010 (Gillard), 2013 (Rudd), 2016 (Turnbull), 2019 (Shorten), and 2022 (Albanese).

The Australian Financial Review (Nine): A Dutton-led Coalition government

“It’s a campaign where Albanese, the architect of the defeated Indigenous Voice to parliament referendum, could not find time to visit a remote Indigenous community, and Dutton, who wants to spend billions nationalising Australia’s energy system, refused to stop by a single site where he plans to build a nuclear reactor.

So with a difficult choice to be made and the prospect of Labor falling under the influence of Green recklessness in the event of a hung parliament, a Dutton government that has offered up slightly more in the way of budget responsibility might be our least worst bet, as unconvincing as he has been.”

Past endorsements: The AFR has endorsed a Coalition government in every election since 1990.

News Corp Australia
The Australian (News Corp): A Dutton-led Coalition government

“We owe our allegiance to no party but rather to what is in the national interest. The choice facing the nation – one of great consequence – must be made against the backdrop of a dispiriting campaign characterised by short-term thinking and a paucity of vision from both sides. But in the key areas of defence, energy and the economy, the Coalition provides the best option for managing the demands of challenging and uncertain times.”

Past endorsements: The Australian has endorsed a Coalition government in each of the past five elections.

The Herald Sun (News Corp): A Dutton-led Coalition government

“When we look to the future, the Herald Sun maintains that Labor hasn’t delivered anywhere near enough to deserve another term of government.

We believe that the Coalition has a better plan to supercharge productivity and get the economy thriving again, with the right mix for energy, to lower costs and take all Australians forward.”

Past endorsements: The Herald Sun has endorsed a Coalition government in each of the past five elections.

The Daily Telegraph (News Corp): A Dutton-led Coalition government

“A poor campaign by the Coalition should not obscure the risk of continued Labor mismanagement. Penny Wong’s high-handed dismissal of Australian voters is a reminder of how Labor sees its role – as straighteners of our national will rather than enablers.

Certainly, a vote for the Coalition would be made in hope for a better performance.

A vote for Labor, however, would guarantee more of the same. The miserable economy-belting, morale-sapping same.”

Past endorsements: The Daily Telegraph has endorsed a Coalition government in each of the past five elections.

The Courier-Mail (News Corp):A Dutton-led Coalition government, with emphasis against the Greens

“The most vital thing in tomorrow’s election is that Australia does not end up with a parliament being held to ransom by the Greens.

“Running a less trouble-plagued campaign than your opponent is not exactly a ringing endorsement that demands another three years as the leader of our nation. Instead, that honour should be hard-won through genuine vision and leadership.

Mr Dutton has shown this in the position he took on the Voice, and in relation to the risk he has taken in promoting a nuclear energy vision.”

Past endorsements: The Courier Mail has endorsed a Coalition government in each of the past five elections.

The Advertiser (News Corp): A majority for either major party

“Peter Dutton would be stronger on national security [...] Our energy security would be safer in his hands.

But if you want to win an election, you have to be able to win a campaign – and Dutton failed on that score.

Should Labor win tomorrow, their campaign of lies will haunt them. Should Dutton win, he will have to outperform his campaign. However, for the good of the country, one of them must win majority government lest our futures be in the hands of the mad Greens, self-serving teals or the independent rabble.”

Past endorsements: 2010 (Gillard), 2013 (Abbott), 2016 (Turnbull), 2019 (Morrison), and 2022 (Morrison).

The Hobart Mercury (News Corp): A Dutton-led Coalition government

“Labor has had three years to provide greater economic stability for struggling families.

The Mercury believes the Coalition is better equipped to provide that economic light at the end of the tunnel.”

Past endorsements: 2010 (Gillard), 2013 (Abbott), 2016 (Turnbull), 2019 (No endorsement), and 2022 (No endorsement)

Other media
The Guardian: An Albanese-led minority Labor government

“It is not ‘hate’ but an assessment of the facts that informs Guardian Australia’s view that Mr Dutton does not appear ready to lead and the Coalition has not demonstrated the policy coherence necessary for effective government.

Progressive Australians are left with strategic choices. If they think the country is best served continuing along the path of gradual change they should vote Labor. If they want to vote strategically, understanding the risk of not knowing the ultimate makeup of the parliament, they may choose the Greens, teals or other alternative candidates in the hope of electing a minority Labor government with a progressive crossbench pushing it to move faster.”

Past endorsements: 2010 (N/A), 2013 (Rudd), 2016 (No endorsement), 2019 (Shorten/Greens), and 2022 (Albanese).

The Canberra Times (Australian Community Media): An Albanese-led Labor government

“Against the backdrop of a chaotic United States, a previously unpopular, uninspiring and timid Albanese government has been made to look responsible and safe, and the opposition to look reckless and even threatening.

Like in Canada earlier this week, a safe set of hands looks a far better electoral choice than a grasping one.”

Past endorsements: 2010 (Gillard), 2013 (Abbott), 2016 (Turnbull), 2019 (No endorsement), and 2022 (Albanese)

The West Australian (Seven West Media): A Dutton-led Coalition government.

“The reality is, the past three years of the Albanese Government has been dreadful. It’s almost as though it has been so bad for so long that we are suffering an extended outbreak of repressed memory.

“The Opposition has been disappointing during this campaign, but when we vote on Saturday it’s a judgment on the past three years of compounding failure. And Anthony Albanese should be punished for it.”

Past endorsements: 2010 (Abbott), 2013 (Abbott), 2016 (Turnbull), 2019 (Morrison), and 2022 (Morrison)

The rest: The Nightly, Seven West Media’s digital newspaper, said Albanese should be punished, backing the Coalition, while Sky News Australia’s Sharri Markson said Peter Dutton would be the “fresh start” Australia needs.

The Australia Financial Review: ""The AFR has endorsed a Coalition government in every election since 1990"", that is so wildly partisan it's fascinating. This has to be contributing  to the ongoing questionable narrative of the LNP as 'better economic managers' that people seem to believe is a fixed law of the universe regardless of what actually seems to play out in the economy during times of government. 

I mean, how exactly has Dutton ""offered up slightly more in the way of budget responsibility""?

Find a population that already lives post-scarcity and see what they do. There are a lot of status competitions, they still have a full emotional range but narrow experience so they freak out of trivial matters, there are a lot of dopamine traps (addiction, exciting games, etc.), then ultimately philanthropy merged with virtue signaling/reputation management (when you win the game you realize the game was stupid and the only thing that really matters is solving problems for other people... but it's more fun when you can use it to show off to your peers. Quitting the game is a strategic move within the game, then you realize it's open ended and inescapable).

Beyond that we'll find something to gang up and compete about, and struggle to exert dominance over one another with -- we're a very hostile species. Then we'll write stories and sing songs about those adventures. Along the way we'll have several rounds of romanticized backsliding (Hey, let's make everything by hand! Hey, let's use vacuum tubes again! Hey, let's sew our own clothes because we can! Hey, I want to raise a pet cow and milk it -- fun -- ""Alexa, how do I care for a cow?"")...

This could have been crushed, but was tacitly allowed because it kept people active making money rather than getting involved in politics and possibly undermining the status quo.",2024-02-02 15:13:59,False
AustralianPolitics,let kids be kids campaign,Chalmers defiant as pressure builds on $3m super tax,"Independent MP Allegra Spender has implored Treasurer Jim Chalmers to rethink his policy to double the earnings tax on high-value superannuation accounts, as some Labor MPs expressed misgivings about proceeding with the policy in its current form.

Chalmers confirmed on Tuesday [his intention to legislate the super tax,](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/labor-pushes-ahead-on-super-tax-comeback-kid-wilson-promises-fight-20250507-p5lx6s) which would tax earnings on superannuation balances over $3 million at 30 per cent rather than 15 per cent, and would include taxing unrealised gains on assets including businesses, farms and shares held in self-managed funds.

Independent MP for Wentworth Allegra Spender (left) voting at Clovelly Surf Life Saving Club. Kate Geraghty

Last term, independent Senate crossbenchers, coached by Spender, [blocked the passage of the legislation,](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/super-tax-grab-set-to-be-shelved-until-after-election-20241125-p5kt76) citing the taxing of unrealised gains and Chalmers’ refusal to index the $3 million threshold.

But after the election, Labor and the Greens have total control of the Senate and the Greens support the tax.

Former Labor prime minister Paul Keating also remains opposed to the policy, both on the principle of taxing unrealised gains and the refusal to index the $3 million threshold.

Keating is telling people that the lack of indexation effectively introduces bracket creep into the super system which he created. He declined to comment.

Spender acknowledged Labor had a mandate to trim superannuation tax concessions, given it took the measure to the election which it won in a landslide, but said it was bad policy.

“The government can say they have won a mandate on reform on high-value super funds, but they need to rethink their approach,” said the teal independent, who holds the Sydney eastern suburbs seat of Wentworth.

Spender said the super tax policy came up consistently at polling booths during the election.

“Community concern is both that this violates a fundamental principle of taxation, but also particularly how it will impact investment in high-growth young businesses on the productivity forefront that are disproportionately supported by SMSFs.

“The government needs to do all it can to encourage investment into high-growth businesses, not undermine it.”

Spender, who accepts she is powerless this time to block the passage of the legislation, said there were sensible alternatives the government should consider.

“Not taxing unrealised gains where realised gains can be accurately calculated is a much better approach.”

Speaking on condition of anonymity, a handful of Labor MPs also said the super tax policy stood out in terms of negative feedback they received at polling booths.

“It was the one thing that was generating hate,” one MP said. “People were saying ‘you’re taxing my super’.”

Audio emerged last week of new Labor MP Matt Gregg, who won the Liberal seat of Deakin, telling voters at a candidates’ night five days before the election he had been told by the party’s leadership they would not be proceeding with the tax.

“The briefing I’ve received is that that is not Labor policy,” he said in a recording leaked to *The Australian*. “I was advised it is not Labor policy.”

The tax will come into effect on July 1 this year and is budgeted to raise $2.3 billion in its first full year of operation, 2027-28, and rise steadily beyond that, to raise $40 billion over a decade.

The government kept the revenue on the books in the pre-election budget it handed down on March 25.

The government has yet to explain how the tax would apply to defined-benefit pensions, such as those owed to politicians who entered parliament before 2004, including Anthony Albanese and, most recently, Peter Dutton.

On Tuesday, Chalmers defended the new super tax as “a very modest change”.

“It only affects half a per cent of people with balances over $3 million,” he said. “It’s still concessional tax treatment, just a little bit less concessional, and it’s an important way that we fund some of our other priorities, including strengthening Medicare or providing income tax cuts, helping with the cost of living and building more homes.

“It’s an important part of our budget, we haven’t changed our approach to it.”

Chalmers acknowledged that there were other parts of the superannuation system in which unrealised gains were calculated but not taxed.

Chalmers’ refusal to index the $3 million threshold will force more and more people to pay the tax and increase revenue. However he suggested someone else would change the threshold eventually.

“It would be a strange assumption to assume that in the next 30 or 40 years nobody ever changes the threshold,” he told Channel Nine’s *Today* show.

“That doesn’t happen in other parts of the tax system, and it wouldn’t happen in this part of the tax system over a period that long.”

Liberal MP Tim Wilson, who led the crusade against Labor’s plan in 2019 to end cash refunds for excess franking credits, criticised his party for not launching a campaign against Labor’s super plans at the last election.

Wilson, who won back his seat of Goldstein from independent Zoe Daniel on May 3, has vowed to go after the tax should he be appointed shadow treasurer in the new Sussan Ley-led opposition.",70,156,Leland-Gaunt-,https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/chalmers-defiant-as-pressure-builds-on-3m-super-tax-20250513-p5lynl,2025-05-13 21:16:30,"**Greetings humans.**

Rich people use super as a way of avoiding tax. The average worker doesn't have 3 million in super. Plus if they do they they can afford to pay 30% tax on the earnings rather than 15%. Thats still a discounted tax rate. Spender is only worried about her wealthy electorate.
---
They have a mandate because almost every single person that voted for them is unaffected by such a tax.

Sure, it might need tweaks (Keating has a fair point regarding indexation), but that's normal.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but superannuation is meant solely to be a retirement fund and not a wealth creation tool. All these people from r/AusFinance harping about the precedent it sets for unrealised capital gains really don't convince me. 

the Superannuation Scheme is not designed to be a wealth creation, capital gains tool but to save the government tons of money of retirement pensioner payments in the long-term. It is an ingenious system by Keating which has kept Australia's pensioner costs per gdp far smaller than most developed countries.

The superannuation scheme comes at a significant cost to the government in terms of tax revenue each year and the decision to put concessional, non-concessional caps, general transfer balance caps are an attempt to keep the purpose of the superannuation scheme to meet its precise purpose of generating retirement funds and not private wealth creation. This purpose is so significant, a fiduciary duty upon the trustee of the superfund which they can be litigated upon with the harshest of remedies and penalties. superannuation money is so legally protected not even creditors can access superannuation from bankrupt debtors.

The flaws in the superannuation system are that high income earners disproportionately benefit from the system as the 15% tax rate of superfunds provides a much higher arbitrage for high income earners taxed at a rate of 47% (a 32% benefit). So the div 293 tax was introduced to help ameliorate some of that exploitation on concessional contributions from taxpayers earning (edit $250,000 from 2017 onwards) with an additional 15% tax. That brings the arbitrage from 15-47% to 30-47%.

But there are still people hoarding over $3m, well above the transfer cap of $2m. So all the new div 296 tax does is subject extra balances over $3m with a final 15%, thereby treating that final amount with the marginal tax (45+2% Medicare levy) that high income payers already should be paying on that money. The government has decided that retirees don't need more than $3m in their super, and I don't see how that is a controversial position. The majority of people with a superannuation fund will not even reach the transfer balance cap of $2m in their life time. This only levels the playing field for the ultra rich exploiting the superannuation scheme to hide their money from being taxed fairly.

If they want a wealth creation tool, they have far more lucrative options like the share market, property, unit trusts and more. A reminder that the superannuation system was never designed to be a capital gains, wealth creation system but only to store retirement funds. The lower tax rate is only privileged to complying superfunds that meet that purpose.

So I saw some old nostalgic stuff from studio 3(abc3) a couple days ago and it kinda had me thinking maybe it's because I'm not actively looking for it but there's as far as I know, fucking nothing being produced for like, the 11-14 demographic professionally.

and that's kinda ass, because the current zheitghiest is about online safety, online radicalisation in children, but where are these fuckers suppose to get entertainment? like they have youtube and insta reels, and maybe some indie animations.

Parenting,Australia under 16 social media ban,"Parents of babies, toddlers and small children, do we think the tides are changing?","Knowing what we all know about the dangers of social media (and unfiltered/unrestricted internet access) and the effect it has on the mental health and behaviour of children, do we think we as parents will be diligent/stringent about what we allow our children to access as they approach tween/teen years? 

Personally, I like to think that neither of my children will have any access to social media until at least 16 years of age (if not later).

I do hear a lot of the arguments made about letting their children have social media these days is to do with not wanting them to be singled out, miss out on friendship discussion etc. However, if we are all on board with none of our children having access to social media, do we think this will take away that argument? 

Are we hoping that in 7, 10 or 15 years time that this obsession with and addiction to social media has changed? What responsibility as parents of young children do you think we have? 

And parents of older children, if you’re here, what advice or hope do you have for the next generation of children growing up?

Talk to your kids. Talk to your kids. Talk to your kids.

My oldest is 16. Her dad is a medical professional. My husband works in tech.

The best and most reliable intervention for everything from drugs to technology is keeping open communication between you and your kids. You can avoid giving them a smartphone or put all sorts of restrictions in place. You can try to never leave them unsupervised. You can keep a close eye on their social group and think they are a drug or alcohol free crowd. The truth is, their friend probably has access to the internet freely, or that game they are playing has a private chat. They will at some point be without an adult by their side. Or with the wrong adult. A friend’s friend may still join in the fun along with some selected party favors.

Don’t treat it like a free for all, but no matter how many restrictions you attempt, the most reliable protection is still talking to your kids.

Additionally, remember that your job is to prepare them to enter the adult world as adults. We very slowly have opened social media to our daughter over time (first Pinterest, just recently instagram teen account) because we want her learning to navigate it and make good decisions under our supervision. We realize the alternative could be a fresh 18 year old diving head first into a pool they don’t understand the depth of.

I think these posts are interesting because I don't think most parents are on parenting subreddits or willingly admit they care what their kids do on social media.

We also don't know what social media will look like in 10-15 years as it's 1000% different than what it was 10 years ago! Facebook is a very much millienail/gen z app, while tiktok/snapchat are heavier with gen z/gen alpha. 

In reality, I will limit my kids social media but I think there needs a balance of teaching a healthy relationship with what social media is, how to properly use it, etc because when then turn 18, and can do whatever, well you just sheltered them from it for their whole life? Now what? Talk with them about it, and not in the ""internet is a scary place"" - that's the talk we got. From all angles of reality, danger, addiction, etc

Teens are sneaky sneaky creatures too. I don't think its as easy as banning social media, but a proper navigation of supervision, educating and limiting to certain degrees (like no tiktok or snapshot, but facebook is okay). But again, social media will look different in 10-15 years so but my parents didn't let me get a smartphone until I graduated high school, and only had access to the internet via the family computer. I just had a generic cellphone that had 0 internet through high school, and did fine but didn't really understand social media from an app perspective until college.

As somebody in the blurry area between technology and education, I feel like we definitely want to just throw computers in fr9nt of kids and assume they know how to use them, then get mad the students for figuring it out. Half of my teachers don't know how to update a computer. The teachers know next to nothing about technology and are required to use technology constantly for everything. 

Also with AI flooding everything it's getting more and more difficult to ensure academic honesty in school without just cutting off most functions of the internet entirely. The cost and resources to effectively manage a school network is too much for poorer districts, yet technology is more and more required to be used. Studies constantly show that technology isn't good for very young students anyways. 

We should be teaching kids how to use technology, not using technology to teach these subjects.

Maybe the schools should ban iPads,  chrome books and phones.  

Go back to teaching using pen and paper and stop putting everything online and telling kids to go to Kahn academy etal for a lesson plan. 

Old school teaching. Maybe the kids will actually have to show up for class instead of saying it’s online and I have until 11:59pm to submit it.

Commenting only on the headline, the teens are correct.  The vast majority of the methods employed for dealing with society-ills is reactionary.  Out of sight out of mind mentality.  Nobody wants to do the hard work of teaching people at a young age how to effectively use technology in this case, but the same is true for so much else, whether it be job skills, navigating healthcare, financial goings-on, and just being caring and helping community members. Sure, the phones are banned at school, but they're right back on them when the bell rings doing all the crap we don't want them to do.  Bans are stopgap bandaids that do little to affect the future wellbeing of our students.
As a teacher at a school with a successful mobile phone ban, the other teachers almost lynched me when I suggested we start teaching the kids how to use the technology appropriately/responsibly so we can start moving away from the ban.  I wish I could use certain educationally valuable tools on the internet in my classes, but the sad truth is it's just not possible with things the way they are now.",2025-03-31 04:24:26,False

Stopping foreign interests from buying property and land — I’d like to see stricter controls on foreign investment in Australian real estate.
Preventing oligarchies — Stopping oligarchies and billionaires controlling the economy and politics.

AustralianPolitics,age verification social media Australia,Election 2025: Cowardly politics is robbing our children blind. It’s time to be brave,"**Ken Henry, Former Treasury secretary, March 29, 2025 — 5.00am**

We find ourselves in an election campaign framed by immediate [cost-of-living](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lk8y) issues, with the principal contenders pandering to an [electorate](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lmkm) they believe to be interested in nothing else.

But are we so venal? Are we so disinterested in the nation’s future? Are we content with being the first generation of Australians unable to state with confidence that future generations will be even better off than we are?

Until the COVID pandemic, the popular view was that Australians were doing well in the 21st century. We were enjoying the tailwinds of a strong Asian market for iron ore, coal and gas that pushed the terms of trade to levels unimagined by any previous generation.

In the two decades pre-COVID, the Australian economy – uniquely in the world – managed to avoid any instance of recession. By contrast, the last two decades of the 20th century saw two deep recessions and a trend decline in the terms of trade.

And yet, with a mining boom, and no recessions, we have managed real GDP per capita growth of less than three-quarters the rate in the 1980s and ’90s. The poorer GDP per capita performance this century is almost fully explained by weaker productivity growth, driven by a succession of populist policy choices. These relate principally to the structure of the tax system, incompetent handling of the mining boom and juvenile political antics in climate policy.

Australia should have been a great place to do business in the first two decades of the 21st century. Yet, notwithstanding the strength of the mining sector, we have had a decade of business investment at levels previously recorded only in deep recessions. Young Australian workers find themselves in an economy so starved of investment that it has been incapable of supporting durable increases in real wages.

And that’s not all.

Because of the structure of the tax system, today’s young people are being denied a reasonable prospect of home ownership, and they are burdened with a trillion dollars of public debt. They are being held back by a tax system that relies increasingly upon fiscal drag, forced to pay higher and higher average tax rates even when their real incomes are falling. This week’s budget papers confirm that fiscal drag remains a core element of the fiscal strategy.

The first intergenerational report (IGR1) was published in 2002. It emphasised that the fiscal implications of an ageing population should be viewed as a growth challenge. If we could lift the rate of economic growth, then we might avoid the need to raise income tax rates on young workers, a cohort destined to make up a declining share of the population.

IGR1 made the case for a set of policy reforms that would lift the rate of real GDP per capita growth modestly above the experience of the 1980s and ’90s, explaining that a failure to do so would impose a heavy fiscal burden on future generations of Australians. But, in the period pre-COVID, we missed the IGR annual growth target by almost a full percentage point.

Other things being equal, had we achieved the target, the Commonwealth budget would be in strong structural surplus, not the decade of structural deficits projected in the latest budget papers. Of course, “other things” have not been equal. Most importantly, the tax system has not been reformed as it should have been, especially to deal with fiscal drag and to boost capital investment and productivity.

This is where some of the higher growth would have come from, with the right reforms. Young workers would have benefited from stronger productivity growth and increases in real wages. Average Australian incomes, pre-tax, would be about 20 per cent higher in real terms. And average after-tax incomes would be even higher.

The economic reforms of the late 20th century were sparked by the Hawke government’s understanding that several decades of poor economic performance, and poor social outcomes, were due to policy squabbles over the distribution of a shrinking pie, a political system disinterested in future generations.

Once again, we find ourselves in that place, in need of leaders with vision and courage. Leaders motivated to put an end to policies and practices that deprive future generations of a set of opportunities most of us have taken for granted.

Australia should be an optimistic country, open to the world, globally competitive, with high rates of productivity growth. To secure that vision, we need an economic policy transformation. Kicking the policy reform can down the road simply won’t do it.

Our leaders should be capable of engaging robustly and effectively with other world leaders, contributing strongly to co-ordinated global action to deal with a set of shared threats to the prosperity of future generations.

Our leaders should have the courage to fix the tax system, to end the lazy reliance upon fiscal drag, to foster high rates of capital investment, and to remove tax distortions that favour investments in capital gains over investments that support productivity and real wages growth.

Our leaders should understand the foundational role of natural capital. They must fix Australia’s broken environmental protection laws. The failure to do so imposes an increasingly large risk burden on a set of investments that will be required to underpin future prosperity, including renewable energy projects. And they should deliver nature repair at scale.

Australia’s next government will have the opportunity to put an end to decades of intergenerational theft. That must be its legacy.

\- Protecting and repairing Australia's environment

AustralianPolitics,social media age restriction Australia,Pollies should kick their poker machine addiction,"

Like John Howard, Shane Stone, the ex-Country Liberal Party chief minister of the Northern Territory, is no bleeding heart. But Stone has now joined the former prime minister’s call for political leaders to introduce stricter measures to curb the harms poker machines are inflicting on indigenous communities.

Two weeks ago, Howard described the proliferation of the pokies in Australia as a “grave social evil”. The comments came in response to an investigation by The Australian Financial Review which revealed the number of poker machines in Alice Springs had risen by 184 over the past four years.

All but 10 of these new machines were in pubs and casinos belonging to IRIS Capital, owned by Sydney-based billionaire and AFR Rich Lister Sam Arnaout. Of the 570 machines in Australia’s desert capital, 470 are located in establishments run by Arnout’s hospitality empire.

Arnaout has done nothing illegal and has complied with the territory’s gambling regulation requirements. It’s the appropriateness of that regulatory regime that is under scrutiny.

The case for measures to reduce problem gambling is not based on old-fashioned wowserism.

Stone tells Friday’s Financial Review, “if I’d had the courage of my convictions, I would have wound back the [poker machine] numbers, but I didn’t do that”.

One of the things he wished he had done differently when leading the Top End between 1995 and 1999 was to restrict poker machine numbers – a sector he regrets grew on his watch.

He says that if you tallied all the downstream costs to the taxpayers linked to pokie addiction, such as bankruptcy, child poverty, domestic violence, family breakdown, and mental illness, the legalisation of poker machines would fail a serious cost-benefit test.

This masthead believes in individual responsibility and allowing the free market to produce the goods and services that people need and want. That includes providing legal gaming for those who choose to have a flutter.

At the same time, Stone is right. The case for stringent harm-minimisation measures to reduce problem gambling is not based on old-fashioned wowserism. It rests on what is known in economics as negative externalities, or when a legal activity produces harmful habits and byproducts for individuals and society at large.

More than a quarter of the NT population is Indigenous, and on average, Territorians lose more money gambling each year than punters in other states and territories.

There is one machine for every 100 people in NT. That is just behind Australia’s pokies capital, with NSW 88,000 machines equating to 92 per head. That level of concentration is second only in the world to Nevada, home of the global gambling mecca Las Vegas.

In Alice Springs, incredibly, there is one for every 50 residents. That one of the country’s most disadvantaged towns has such a high penetration of machines is a telling sign of how the pokies industry thrives on social misery.

Indigenous leaders in “The Alice” report that pokie addiction is a big problem for some vulnerable members of the town’s Indigenous community, compounding broader social problems. After the failure of the Voice referendum, taking these concerns seriously and acting to reduce the harm caused by the pokies sounds like a much more meaningful way to help close the gap and improve socio-economic outcomes for Indigenous Australians.

Capping the number of machines is a logical harm reduction strategy to minimise the prevalence and temptation of the pokies. This is opposed by the politically powerful hotel lobbyists who claim this would lead to the closure of venues and job losses.

Yet Western Australia’s policy of permitting pokies only in casinos and banning them in pubs and clubs has hardly reduced the state’s ability to employ and serve people in the hospitality sector.

There is no good reason why the cash limits on poker machines that Star Entertainment and Crown Casino have been forced to implement to reduce problem gambling and money laundering should not also apply to pubs and clubs.

To its discredit, the NSW Labor government led by Premier Chris Minns substituted a trial program for predecessor Dominic Perrottet’s plan for a mandatory statewide cashless pokies and pre-commitment scheme.

That points to the overarching problem: state governments are addicted to poker machine gambling tax revenues, which they are reluctant to give up and which encourage turning a blind eye to the collateral social damage.

Howard has called on Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to spearhead national gambling reform and for the Liberal Party to give bipartisan support. That would follow the precedent set by the Howard government’s national gun ban and buyback scheme after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre.

It shouldn’t have to come to this to get better poker machine regulation.

AustralianPolitics,Albanese social media ban,Young people must fight for democracy,"# Young people must fight for democracy

Grace Tame

Across the pond, democracy is on its death bed following a decades-long battle with untreated corporate cancer. The escalating battle between the Trump administration and the United States Supreme Court over the former’s dubious deportations and denial of due process could be the final, fatal blow. Here in Australia at least, while not free of infection, democracy is still moving, functional and, most importantly, salvageable.

On May 3, we go to the polls to cast our ballot in another federal election. The ability to vote is a power that should not be underestimated. Neither by us, as private citizens holding said power, nor by candidates vying for a share of it.

For the first time, Gen Z and Millennials outnumber Boomers as the biggest voting bloc. I can’t speak for everyone, but the general mood on the ground is bleak. Younger generations in particular are, rightfully, increasingly disillusioned with the two-party system, which serves a dwindling minority of morbidly wealthy players rather than the general public.

We’re tired of the mudslinging, scare campaigns, confected culture wars and other transparent political theatrics that incite division while distracting the public and media from legitimate critical issues. We don’t need games. We need bold, urgent, sweeping economic and social reforms. There’s frankly no time for anything else.

Last year was officially the hottest on record globally, exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Multinational fossil fuel corporations continue to pillage our resources and coerce our elected officials while paying next to no tax.

Australia is consequently lagging in the renewable energy transition, despite boasting a wealth of arid land suitable for solar and wind farming, as well as critical mineral reserves such as copper, bauxite and lithium, which could position us as a global renewable industry leader and help repair our local economy and the planet. We could leverage these and other resources in the same way we leverage fossil fuels – instead we’re fixated on the short-term benefits of the rotting status quo. 

The median Australian house price is more than 12 times the median salary. Students are drowning in debt. The cost of living is forcing too many families to choose between feeding themselves and paying rent.

The current patterns of property ownership are unprecedented. More people are living alone. They are living longer. Houses are worth more, so owners are holding on to them. Thanks to negative gearing and capital gains tax breaks, it’s cheaper to buy your 33rd property than it is to buy your first.

Healthcare providers are overburdened, understaffed, underpaid. Patients nationwide are waiting months to access costly treatment. Childhood sexual abuse is almost twice as prevalent as heart disease in this country – but the public health crisis of violence that affects our most vulnerable is barely a footnote on the Commonwealth agenda. Last year alone, 103 women and 16 children died as a result of men’s violence. At time of writing, 23 women have been killed by men this year.

Instead of receiving treatment and support, children as young as 10 are being incarcerated, held in watch houses, and ultimately trapped in an abusive cycle of incarceration that is nearly impossible to escape by design.

For more than 18 months we have watched live footage of Israel’s mass killings of civilians in Gaza. Women and children account for two thirds of the victims. Our elected officials choose to focus on anti-Semitism, without addressing legitimate criticism of Israel’s actions. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese can disingenuously claim “we’re not a major player in the region” all he likes, while denying we sell arms to Israel, but there’s no denying our desperate dependency on its biggest supplier, the US. There’s more than one route to trade a weapon. We are captured by the military industrial complex.

If it weren’t already obvious, on October 14, 2023, the majority of eligible voters confirmed to the rest of the world that Australia is as susceptible to fear as it is racist, by voting against constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

I could go on, but I have only 1500 words.

In the 1970s, Australia earnt its status as a strong middle power amid the resource boom. Mining fossil fuels became the backbone of our economy. Not only has this revenue model grown old, clunky and less effective, it’s destroying the planet. Sadly, when forewarned of the dangers of excess carbon emissions more than 50 years ago, governments the world over chose profit over the health and future of our planet.

The delay in transitioning to renewables is the cause of the rising cost of energy. It’s not a “supply issue”, as both major parties would have you believe, it’s a prioritisation issue. Most of our coal-fired power stations have five to 10 years left, at best. The more money we spend propping up fossil fuels, the less we have to invest in the energy transition. We won’t have the impetus to shift fast enough to keep up with other countries, and we will continue to suffer both domestically and globally as a consequence.

If re-elected, Labor has pledged to increase our energy grid from 40 per cent renewables to 82 per cent by 2030; reduce climate pollution from electricity by 91 per cent; and unlock $8 billion of additional investment in renewable energy and low-emissions technologies. The stakes are high. There is trust to be earnt and lost. Older generations, who are less likely to experience the worsening impacts of global warming, are no longer the dominant voice in the debate. For an already jaded demographic of young voters, climate change isn’t a hypothetical, and broken promises will only drive us further away from traditional party politics.

The current Labor government approved several new coal and gas projects over the course of its first term and has no plans to stop expansions, but at least Anthony Albanese acknowledges the climate crisis, citing action as “the entry fee to credibility” during the third leaders’ debate this week.

In contrast, a Liberal-led Dutton government would “supercharge” the mining industry, push forward with gas development in key basins, and build seven nuclear plants across the country. Demonstrating the likelihood of success of this policy platform, when asked point blank by ABC debate moderator David Speers to agree that we are seeing the impact of human-caused climate change, Peter Dutton had a nuclear meltdown. He couldn’t give a straight answer, insisting he is not a scientist. As if the overwhelming, growing swathes of evidence had been locked away in a secret box for more than half a century.

Dutton now wants to distance himself from the deranged Trumpian approach to politics, but he is showing his true colours. Among them, orange.

While Albanese has consistently voted for increasing housing affordability, Peter Dutton has consistently voted against it, even though he has a 20-year-old son who can’t afford a house. Luckily, as the opposition leader confirmed, Harry Dutton will get one with help from his father.

The trouble is, in Australia, shelter is treated as an asset instead of a basic human right. Successive governments on both the right and left have conspired to distort the market in favour of wealthy investors and landlords at the expense of the average punter. We’re now feeling the brunt of compounding policy failures. We need multiple, ambitious policies to course-correct.

The current patterns of property ownership are unprecedented. More people are living alone. They are living longer. Houses are worth more, so owners are holding on to them. Thanks to negative gearing and capital gains tax breaks, it’s cheaper to buy your 33rd property than it is to buy your first.

Rather than admit accountability, we’re once again being told by the Coalition to blame migrants, who pay more taxes and are entitled to fewer benefits, therefore costing less to the taxpayer. Incidentally, if the major parties are so afraid of migrants, they should stop enabling wars that drive people to leave their home countries. Of course, they’re not actually afraid of migrants. They’re their most prized political pawns. Among the measures pitched by Dutton to fix the economy are reduced migration, and allowing first-home buyers and older women to access up to $50,000 from their super towards a deposit for their first home. One is a dog whistle, the other is deeply short-sighted.

On top of reducing student loan debt by 20 per cent, Labor plans to introduce a 5 per cent deposit for first-home buyers – which isn’t a silver bullet either.

They could have spent time developing meatier policies that would have really impressed the young voters they now depend on. Instead, candidates from across the political spectrum released diss tracks and did a spree of interviews on social media, choosing form over content.

We’re in a social and economic mess, but in their mutual desperation for power, both Labor and the Coalition have offered small-target, disconnected, out-of-touch solutions.

The elephant in the room is the opportunity cost of not enforcing a resource rent tax on fossil fuel corporations. Imagine the pivotal revenue this would generate for our economic and social safety net.

I could listen to Bob Katter give lessons on metaphysics all day, but I generally don’t have much time for politicians. My most memorable encounter with one was sadly not photographed. It was in Perth at the 2021 AFL grand final between the Western Bulldogs and Melbourne. I was standing next to Kim Beazley, and was dressed as a demon with tiny red horns in my hair – fitting, considering I am probably some politicians’ worst nightmare. To be fair, the distrust is mutual, although in this instance I was quite chuffed to be listening to Kim, who is an affable human being and a great orator. He encouraged me to go into politics and insisted that to have any real success I needed to be with one of the major parties.

I disagree. And no, I will *not* be going into politics.

Unlike the US, ours is not actually a two-party political system. Hope lies in the potential for a minority government to hold the major parties to account.

Not only do we need to reinvent the wheel but we need to move beyond having two alternating drivers and also change the literal source of fuel.

We want representatives in parliament who reflect the many and diverse values of our communities, not narrow commercial interests. We want transparency, integrity and independence.

Our vote is our voice. If we vote without conviction, we have already lost. We must vote from a place of community and connection. That is how we save democracy.

AustralianPolitics,Albanese social media ban,"Election 2025: Young men are leaning right, but not necessarily to Peter Dutton","You might think Aftab Bismi, 30, would be a shoo-in to vote for the Coalition on Saturday. The data consultant thinks progressive politics has created a society where young men like him feel they have to walk on eggshells. He grew up Muslim, works hard, trains hard, and is focused on making as much money as he can.

“I don’t think men have changed, but I think the world has become more progressive,” he says. “I wouldn’t say I’m voting for financial reasons, but I’m more interested in financial policies because it has more of an impact on my day-to-day life.”

It is a similar story with Jacob Bicknell, a 30-year-old engineer who held socially progressive views, shifted to Catholicism in his 20s and found himself steadily growing more conservative.

“People talk about an assault on masculinity. People complain about it a lot, and it’s definitely real,” he says. “Conservatism gives young men a more positive vision of themselves.”

Both men represent a very real and consequential ideological shift among young Australians. The [chasm](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5l7e3) between how young men and women see their political views widened dramatically at the last election, putting the sexes further apart than ever. Young women stayed leftward, while young men leapt rightwards – and experts expect they’ve stayed there.

The splintering of the sexes was a key feature of last year’s US presidential election. Democratic candidate Kamala Harris won among young women, but young men [helped deliver](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5kosg) the White House to Donald Trump. The potential power of the young vote is too potent for Australian political parties to ignore.

While Bismi and Bicknell are leaning to the Coalition, both say they remain undecided. They are young men who have trended conservative, but not yet definitively landed in Dutton’s lap. If the opposition leader cannot count on young men who are straying from progressive youth traditions, then he is unlikely to win.

But how they and other Millennial and Gen Z men vote on May 3 will reveal much more than just the next prime minister. When the dust settles, it will say much about how polarised the youngest cohorts have become and raise questions about support for everything from immigration, racial justice, sexual harassment and gender equality – not to mention what it might mean for future marriage and birth rates.

*The Australian Financial Review* has reviewed decades of results from the Australian Election Study, an influential survey that has questioned thousands of voters about their views after each election since 1987.

Analysis of the survey, carried out by the Australian National University, reveals that while young people have generally been trending more progressive since about 2000, young men leapt rightwards between 2019 and 2022.

The study asks people where they sit on a scale between 0 and 10, where zero means left-wing and 10 means right-wing. Among people between 18 and 29 years old in 2022, women were 3.8 on average, while men were a 4.6. The 0.8 point gap is the widest in recorded history for that age group. Pollsters and political strategists say the gap has likely remained, or even widened.

It has been a tough few years for young people. The worst inflation crisis in a generation sent student debts soaring and added fuel to a housing affordability crisis. Meanwhile, shifting definitions of masculinity, the #MeToo movement, and social media that nurtures male insecurities have triggered attitudes that blame “woke” values for diminishing the status of men.

This is not unique to Australia. The *Financial Times* [reported](https://www.ft.com/content/29fd9b5c-2f35-41bf-9d4c-994db4e12998) early last year on the emerging ideological gap between young men and women in the US, the United Kingdom, Germany and South Korea.

“In the US … after decades where the sexes were each spread roughly equally across liberal and conservative world views, women aged 18 to 30 are now 30 percentage points more liberal than their male contemporaries,” the *FT* wrote.

“That gap took just six years to open up … this shift could leave ripples for generations to come, impacting far more than vote counts.”

In the first election where [Gen Z](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5loi0) and Millennials (which captures adults between 18 and 44 years old) outnumber Baby Boomers or Gen X at the ballot boxes, this is a political opportunity for the Coalition.

**This is easier said than done.** A shift to the right among young men does not necessarily mean they will vote accordingly, says Ian McAllister, a professor of political science at ANU and director of the Australian Election Study.

“It’s a very good measure of people’s ideological position but not a good marker of voting behaviour,” he says. That’s because the changed ideology has occurred amid another major trend: a move away from major parties.

“If you think that people who are sitting on the left are going to vote Labor, it’s not necessarily true,” he says. “For people under 24 \[in 2022\], more people voted Green than Coalition.”

The 2022 election delivered the lowest primary vote for the Liberal Party since the party was founded in 1944, according to the ANU researchers. The Labor Party had its lowest vote since at least 1934.

At the same time, says Flinders University’s Intifar Chowdhury, as “Millennials are ageing, they’re not becoming more conservative like Gen X or Baby Boomers did”.

Underlining the gender gap, Chowdhury – who lectures on government and has studied youth voting patterns for years – says that “women are moving to the left at a faster pace compared to men”.

If appealing to young men is an opportunity for Dutton, Albanese has jumped on the same trend. He has spoken directly to younger female audiences this campaign by appearing on targeted podcasts – *It’s A Lot* with Abbie Chatfield and *Happy Hour with Lucy and Nikki*, for example.

“With the younger generation, \[parties\] are aware of the volatility of the vote. Even though Albanese is aware that young females voted against the Coalition last time around, the fact that he’s trying to appeal to younger women and not taking their vote for granted just shows that,” she says.

“Back in the day, you could bank on your stable voter base. Not any more. I think all eyes are on Gen Z voters this time around.”

**Dutton’s campaign so far would indicate** he is deeply aware of the power of the young male vote. When Dutton joined mortgage millionaire Mark Bouris’ podcast earlier this year, he made a direct appeal to this bloc of voters.

“I think a lot of young males feel disenfranchised,” he said in response to a question about the origin of the “woke” movement. Young men were being told they were “some sort of ogre” for having a wife stay home with children, Dutton said. “I think there’s a point where people are fed up and they’re pushing back.”

Alongside his appearance on Bouris’ show, Dutton has turned up on Olympian-turned-YouTube influencer Sam Fricker’s podcast *Diving Deep.* The Liberal Party has meanwhile been pushing hard into [so-called “brain rot”](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/this-influencer-got-in-election-hot-water-here-s-why-20250331-p5lnrw?post=p58fto) – poor quality, often artificial intelligence-generated content for social media – that resonates with young men. AI rats in business suits and Minecraft gameplay litter the party’s TikTok feed.

More recently, Dutton was on the campaign trail with his [20-year-old son Harry](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/we-re-saving-like-mad-dutton-s-son-rises-for-star-campaign-turn-20250414-p5lrkh), who blamed the Albanese government for not being able to afford a home. “I am saving up for a house and so is my sister, Bec, and a lot of my mates, but as you probably heard, it’s almost impossible to get in, in the current state,” Harry said.

There is a clear audience for this pitch. Polling by progressive research firm Essential Media earlier this month found 46 per cent of young men (18 to 24-year-olds) approved of Dutton’s performance. Just 26 per cent of young women felt the same.

“I’ve never seen gender splits as big as this,” Peter Lewis, executive director of Essential, says. “We’re in a position where people don’t empathise and relate to other groups, they are pushed into their algorithmically gated communities, a constituency of one.”

And yet, it doesn’t seem to be working. The latest polling shows it has not yet meaningfully translated into either a more conservative or Coalition vote.

Freshwater Strategy’s aggregated [polling](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5l7p3) from February and March compared to late 2022 showed the widening divide between the genders at the ballot box was driven by young women, not young men.

Women in this age group are twice as likely as men to vote for the Greens. Coalition support also stands at just over one-third of young men, compared to one in four young women. The 18 to 34-year-old cohort is the furthest apart on a two-party-preferred basis as well.

Gen Z and Millennial men are more focused than their female peers on a leader they think will provide better life circumstances and economic management, Freshwater Strategy director Michael Turner says.

But while they prioritise economic issues, their conservatism is not the top factor behind how they vote, he added. “Prosperity, income, getting on the housing ladder – those are sorts of things young men care about,” he says. “Less so for cultural issues.”

The political fallout from this gender rift may be years away. “The people who will be influenced by conservatism and the ‘manosphere’ are looking to be a population that’s not voting yet – Gen Alpha,” Turner says, referring to the cohort of children born from the early 2010s that will follow Gen Z.

What Dutton is attempting locally has not worked elsewhere. Though they are identifying as more conservative than their female peers, young men were not a standout group in the most recent elections in the UK and New Zealand, Freshwater data shows.

**The cumulative weight of these data points** is a politically powerful cohort that is nevertheless difficult to harness. Trump succeeded while others failed. From a focus group of two, Bismi and Bicknell, it does not appear likely Dutton has yet pulled it off.

“I wouldn’t say he’s appealed to me. If anything, he’s probably backed out of it a little, moving away from shrinking bureaucracy,” Bicknell says.

Bismi says his sense is that the Coalition appeals to aspirational young men who wanted to own their home and build wealth. He was less motivated by cultural issues and “identity politics”, which carves people into particular identities and groups for political ends.

“I feel like people have individual notions of justice and welfare and things that drive them beyond a simple label,” he says. “That might reflect other young men’s thoughts as well.”

The power of the Gen Z and Millennial vote will continue to grow. The issues at play this election aren’t going away, either. “The things I most care about are cost of living and being a first home buyer,” Bismi says. “Those things affect your discretionary spending. And your perceived level of happiness.”

“Young men are turning conservative, just look at these two that actively practice religion as an example”
---
What this article briefly touches on (but never quite articulates in full) is the fundamental paradox at the heart of the LNP's ideology, particularly when it comes to courting less wealthy voters. They love to pay lip service to culture wars and they tell socially conservative people what they want to hear - but when push comes to shove, they won't lift a finger to actually help these people's wallets. And it seems that people are finally starting to wake up to that.

This is the national con that the LNP have been running on Australia for decades now. By convincing the public that ""wokeness"" is somehow more important than economic issues, they successfully trick lower-income voters into voting against their best economic interests.

The reality is that conservatives *need* culture wars to win elections. Otherwise, they'd have to be judged on the merits of their economic policies alone - and deep down, they know that's a battle they would lose.

As someone who was close to going down the rabbit hole of guys like Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro, I can say right now these people don’t care about us. They’re products of a system that sells all of us out for profits and self interests. The conservative politicians we have, are only out to protect that system, where they can make themselves and their wealthy buddies wealthier while the rest of us argue about who should have what rights and whether things are too “woke” now. 

The longer we continue arguing and fighting amongst ourselves, the more they’ll continue buying up all the assets and resources, inflating their values and forcing people into financial stress and poverty. 

I agree men need more support (frankly everyone in society does), but specifically men haven’t felt involved in the conversation in a way that helps understand why things are changing and what it means for them. There are still men being asked to change who don’t fully understand how, or they do and encounter other people who use it against them. E.g. they date a woman who criticises them for being vulnerable with their emotions.",2025-04-28 20:05:15,False
Futurology,young people and social media ban,Built-In Toxicity - Why social media companies don’t care about your wellbeing — and why they should,"
We all have spam filters for email.
So why don’t we have the same for toxic comments on social media?

With all the advances in technology, it would be easy to give users the ability to auto-hide hostile, dehumanizing, or aggressive content the same way we hide spoilers or graphic images.
But platforms don’t offer that.

Why?

Because anger, outrage, and insult drive clicks.
And clicks drive profit.

That’s the ugly truth:
Toxicity isn’t accidental. It’s engineered.
Platforms don’t just allow toxic content, in many cases their algorithms amplify it.

It doesn’t have to be this way.

We could have simple tools that let users:

1)Auto-hide toxic replies based on severity

2)Set personal thresholds for what they see

3)Choose to expand or engage only if they want to

No bans. No censorship. Just control.

The fact that these tools don’t exist, that there’s no “toxicity filter” like a spam folder, isn’t just an oversight.
It’s a design failure. A harmful one.

If platforms won’t protect our mental health, we have to start demanding tools that do.
Tools that protect people, not just profit margins.

The solution is simple.

Stop using platforms that fail to implement proper user safety controls. People are already flocking to BlueSky in the mass Twitter-Exodus.

Why? Fewer users means less subscription and ad revenue for the platform that fails to adapt.

Why is Reddit so infested with bots and AI generated content?

Because none of the real human users want to wade through the sea of negative toxicity any time they raise their head above the parapet.

It would *relatively* easy to make a browser plugin that filtered out comments judged to be toxic by sentiment analysis. I believe it's possible but a bit harder to do it for mobile.

Unplug from social media entirely. Start small and work your way through it. There are exceptions like businesses and organizations where you can't avoid but the statement remains true.

Is it true you're Leo Puglisi's dad?

Also thank you for being one of the only good tech journalists in the country. Also why do you think Australians don't follow big tech stories?

Do you think Australia is deeply behind in terms of tech and a digital economy compared to other Western nations? 

How bad do you think lobbying by tech companies are in Australia?

It was insane seeing Bunnings as THE most trust brand in Australia - literally a week after they were just hit with a privacy scandal.

Q: is the social media ban a DeadCat designed to distract from Cost of Living pressures in the media cycle?




I do acknowledge the impacts social media can have on mental health, and I think it is something that once made aware the government has every right to look into.
But as someone with a technical background this seems like the absolute worst approach to solve the issue. 
If it was something they were serious about addressing then this wouldn't be the way you would go about it.
I see it as akin to accepting gambling advertising is bad, and rather than removing it from where kids can see it, we just add a 'gsmble responsible' tag right at the end.

Education,social media age restriction Australia,The Worsening Afflictions of the Upcoming Generations - General Crisis,"Hello, I think there is a serious societal crisis underway. This crisis manifests itself in the high rates of anxiety, depression, pessimism, anger, attention disorders, etc. within school children. I think we need to discuss this crisis and its causes.

I do not have deeply developed thoughts on it, but I will try to generate some discussion. Let me start with asking some questions:

* Why are school children suffering from so many disorders? What are the sources of depression, anxiety, anger, pessimism / nihilism, disinterest, detachment, etc.?
* Should we situate the problem at a family level, national level, or global level? Or, does the crisis cut across all of these?
* Is the crisis primarily in the minds of the students? Or, is it because of the material organization of society? Or, both?

***My thoughts on the multifaceted yet interconnected sources of the crisis:***

**Economy:** The economic circumstances of contemporary society exerts an immense amount of pressure on individuals within nearly every age bracket. The children within school today begin to feel the competitive pressures of academic achievement in order to realize future economic opportunities at a very early age. These pressures are quite different than the pressures experienced 50 years ago. Previously, students could drop out of high school and still obtain a job that offers decent living wages. Grocery stores up until the 1990s are an example of this. There is now much more competitive pressure and far less economic opportunity. The younger generations recognize both the pressures and the bleak economic prospects. The inability to live up to these pressures make them question their own self-value. 

**Identity Confusion:** The social norms have become increasingly problematized and contested, and I think without establishing relatively stable and inclusive norms, the children experience confusion in relation to these norms. For example, as a society, does not have coherent, consensual answers to questions such as: what is sex / gender? which sexual orientations are acceptable? which models of femininity / masculinity should be embraced? how much should I sexualize myself? 

However, these questions are not restricted to the sexual realm. They also include questions such as: which political leaders and politics should I support? is capitalism good or bad? what is the meaning of nationality? who belongs to the nation? should I eat meat or not? does humanity even have a future? 

I believe that the de-stabilized, contested nature of contemporary societal norms results in intensified confusion amongst younger generations because the problematization of the norms simultaneously entails the problematization of the various dimensions of their identities. It is good that the norms have been critically questioned to make them more inclusive, but now our identities are no longer naturally given as they once were. To navigate the de-stabilized identity norms can be very confusing. 

**Fragmented Communities:** The contested nature of the social norms expresses the fragmented nature of contemporary societies. We live in heightened levels of individualism, social division, interpersonal separation, and group segregation. It seems to me that within such a cultural atmosphere, children play outside far less than they used to, feel much more disconnected from the larger society, and experience themselves as less recognized / more isolated. The feeling of common trust, reciprocal association, shared direction within society has collapsed. Such an overwhelmingly private, separated, and distrusting form of contemporary life is not delivering high levels of fulfilment to the younger generations. 

**Climate Change and the Lack of Progress:** The feeling of hope arises by establishing a positive relation to the future. Unfortunately, climate change negates the younger generations positive relation to the future. We, as a society, are failing to overcome contemporary problems. Our children feel let down by us. Rather than progress, the society seems to be descending further into conflict and de-stabilization. The feelings of pessimism, despair, and hopelessness experienced by school children are generated by contemporary society's inability to provide them with a comfortable, healthy future. 

**Family Problems**: The economic problems, social separations, and political and normative conflicts deeply affect families as more families are becoming divided over normative and political conflicts, collapsing due to economic turmoil, and / or dissolving due drug / mental health problems. The general societal crisis implies a crisis of the home. An increasing amount of children are no longer being brought up within stable, supportive family households. Intergenerational divides are becoming worse as the worlds of adults and children are increasingly separated and mutually misunderstood.

**The Impacts of the Crises on Children:** Everywhere the children are looking they are being confronted with more and more problems. It seems to me that they perceive a disintegrating society suffering from massive inequality, climate disaster, destabilized norms, and minimal hope of overcoming the issues. The children do not feel empowered nor adequately recognized. Their voices and concerns are generally dismissed by the public at large. Consequently, their nerves are so fried that they must drug themselves to remain calm. The increasing turn to both prescribed and unprescribed drugs is an attempt to escape the bleak realities they confront. The conflicted world in which they live has been and continues to upset their self-relation.

I see several which are never given much investigation

\- The rise of the 2 parent wage earner means that kids are on sheltered at home more, esp with the unfounded concept of stranger danger.

\- With few adults home all day, and the domination of isolated suburban communities, there is no networking with neighbors, which once provided a community  looking after each other. 

\- Local TV news pushes every one to be constantly vigilant against others

\- The reliance on TV, Cell phones and Computers (starting in the 50s) meant more people & their kids are hiding at home and not out at clubs, or community wide activities.  Every one thinks they are an island, and its become closer to every one against the world by themselves. This includes organized religion, which once was a central focus for a family's social and civic network. Religion was only a part of those institutions. 

\- The unresolved aspects of sex and racial divide continues and makes many parents to over react. 

\- The rise of income inequality creates a fear, by the Haves, that the poor are always after their riches.

I have been teaching 7-12th grade for the last decade. The threat of a school shooting is much more prevalent now than when I started. 

Students are also much more disenchanted with the idea of college and education in general. They see millenials drowning in student loan debt, unable to find meaningful work at a decent wage, and think, ""What's the point?"" 

They watched us shut the world down for 2 years where grades didn't matter, and we priorotized mental/physical health only to shove them abruptly back into the rat race. I can see why they don't want to buy in to education or other societal expectations. 

I really hope the upcoming generations will bring new perspectives and priorities, but I worry they won't have the educational foundation to enact the change they want to see. I worry that nihilism will keep them from investing the energy into even defining what that change is.

*Why are school children suffering from so many disorders? What are the sources of depression, anxiety, anger, pessimism / nihilism, disinterest, detachment, etc.?*

Better diagnosis and reduction of the stigma about mental illness for actual disorders.   Not everything in the list is an actual disorder, however.  

  
*Should we situate the problem at a family level, national level, or global level? Or, does the crisis cut across all of these?*

In the US specifically, income inequality has been increasing over the past 50 years, and almost nobody on the political stage is addressing that.  Compared to most other advanced economies, the US lacks universal healthcare and free public higher education, the US life expectancy is therefore among the lowest of our group.  Very much a US issue.    
*Is the crisis primarily in the minds of the students? Or, is it because of the material organization of society? Or, both?*

The ""crisis"" has been painted with a very broad bush, but about ""material organization,"" a turn of the dial closer to ""social democracy"" would address many of these issues.  

By the way, about ""Identify Confusion,"" that comes with living in a Free country, people are better off being able to make choices, not some ""Big Brother"" leader telling them what to do.

Not enough beauty and genuine fun in their lives.  Many live in bleak neighborhoods and don't experience natural beauty.  Many spend hours a day stuck to screens in dismal living spaces with stressed parents.  School is also bleak and focused on basic skills run by a teacher who has too many students and too many responsibilities.  Community and family social time is limited.  Focus on material things leads to grave disappointment.

For some of the disorders, it’s simply that people are getting better at talking about it and identifying them.

Most of social media, and probably society in general (to a lesser extent), especially those under 30, seem to think you also literally change the second you turn 18, and a lot of people literally think at 18 or 19, you can't even date a 16 or 17 year old.

Someone I knew said they were also accused of being a pedophile once on Deviantart just because they say ""children and teenagers"" instead of calling both ""children."" The idiot literally told them that only pedophiles separate kids by age group and blocked them so they couldn't defend themselves in case people mindlessly believed them. 
The accused is a CSA survivor, and the grooming they went through at a young age left them with lasting trauma.

It gets worse from here, too. Lawmakers, particularly anti-trans lawmakers, are trying to push the age up so the term ""child"" means up to the age of 24. There's already a 7 year max wait for Healthcare, meaning a lot of trans adults will have to wait until they're 31 to get it.

Also, 18 and 16 is a two year age gap. Going by their logic, my partner is grooming me even though we're both in our 20s

As an adult, this is something I try to be conscious of.

The answer pretty much boils down to the fact that adults have a lot to gain out of infantilizing aka dehumanizing teenagers/minors in general and essentially treating them as property and second rate citizens. Since the ageist system works to the benefit of adult agents: a useful (and very strategic tool) is language, and referring to a seventeen year old as a ""child"" subconsciously reinforces the idea that teenagers belong in a lowly position in society and make sense in a place of subordination within their dynamic with adults who entirely control their lives instead of being taken seriously and at all empowered/in any position of power or somehow exercising their own right to agency and freedom. If you liken a teenager to a toddler, people don't have to consider their rights in the matter of their finances, property, time, and other resources. They don't even have to question the legal physical abuse of teenagers because parents understandably ""own"" their baby/toddler's body in the context of making them hold their hand crossing the street, giving them a bath, changing them, etc.",2024-12-27 23:42:01,False

In a big way, just having an extra two hours a day has ripple effects. 

On a very localized level, having a lot more remote work has made my immediate neighborhood more neighborly. We are seeing each other during lunch, walking the dog, in the evening because we are home sooner, etc. I have met new neighbors, more around the block, I may have seen before but wouldn’t have stopped to talk to, for example, just because I used to get home, an extra hour lost on commuting either end, and was rushed to walk the dog, make dinner, etc. 

The kids also play outside more, for example, much of winter used to just be dark by the time they got home.

We go out to local restaurants, if anything, more because we aren’t as rushed in general. And likewise are cooking more elaborate things at home, shopping for fresh food more frequently.

The trade off is of course WHERE the establishments we are patronizing are. More smaller neighborhood places versus bigger centrally located ones.

I can't answer about zoom towns, only my personal experience being a remote dev in a small town.  There are a few of us remote workers, and once in a while I get together with some of them.  A couple of us were already civically engaged, but are moreso now because of the extra hours in the day not spent in a car.  One guy serves on a HOA board and is extremely engaged with his kids' school.  I'm on a volunteer board for the town and run an adult sports program, and assistant coach the associated youth program.  

I'd love to know if we're somehow different from towns without a remote worker population explosion rather than a handful of peeps who already lived here going remote.
---
People who work from home still get involved with the community.  In fact, they will more likely be a larger part of the community since they have more free time since they're not commuting.

They'll also have more money on hand and more incentive to get involved since now they're only going out when they want to, rather than because they have to go out, again to commute.

The economic aspect is well known, as you said, as there are whole communities competing to get WFH workers to move to their states/regions to take advantage of out-of-area tax dollars coming in from WFH workers.  

The social side of things should be equally apparent.  WFH workers have more time, more money and more incentive to get involved in their communities.

I have been WFH for 15 years now, the extra freedom it gives me, allows me to volunteer in the community more. I coach youth sports, have been on several community boards and have only been able to do this since WFH started. It has allowed me to live in a remote rural community and avoid cities almost completely. Almost all of my shopping is done locally, unless it's a specialty item so I can support the smaller retailers in my area. It has been a huge improvement in my quality of life overall and I wish more people had the freedom to work this way.

I am a Canadian now permanently living in South America with a remote work job.

I believe remote work in this capacity is going to shrink the world over the next years. I think this will become more and more popular, so countries will start making getting visas easier.

As it gets easier to live in other countries, we will be exposed to more cultures, styles of living. As we mix and mingle more as a species I hope the racism goes down. But who knows, I do think that in 20 years there will be a decent percentage of people working remotely from different countries.

As a queer person I'm very worried about this, because social media is a common platform for queer teenagers to find community, especially if they are closeted. I don't think I would have made it past 18 if I didn't have that outlet online, where people could build connections and share experiences, and remind each other that they are not alone in the world. 

Florida is clamping down heavily on queer expression and representation in schools, libraries, etc. because there are some people who believe children will and must turn out ""normal"" if they're sheltered from the reality that queer people already exist. Right now a common transphobic talking point is that ""social contagion"" and ""grooming"" on social media (and other platforms) are turning children trans. 

I don't just hate this bill because of the possible ID requirements, but because it criminalizes queer teenagers' communities.

-----  
It's a desire for a solution to a poorly defined problem.  
  
How is 'social media defined' ?  
Will children be banned from all electronic communications, or a subset, will they be allowed to have an email address ?  
  
Parental Consent  
What if parents are willing to supervise their children, is the government going to override the way a parent might  choose to bring up their child ?  
  
Can the laws be enforced ?  
I cant see how it can be enforced internationally, children may only need to be smart enough to lie about their nationality.  
There is a famous quote by John Gilmore, 'The internet sees censorship as damage and routes around it'.   
  
Will a ban protect children from harm ?  
Technology cant solve human behavioural problems. A bully will find a way, even without social media.  
If undesirable content is blocked from social media, it won't necessarily protect them from the same content on the wider internet.  
  
Is social media the problem ?  
In the flurry of discussion by journalists and politicians, none have mentioned the good side of social media... a  comment on reddit i saw from a gender diverse person highlighted that the anonymity of social media made them  feel safe.  
Personally, my first experience with the internet left me with a profound sense of connection, that there are people out there like me, and thats just because of my love of tech.  
  
Cultural Enrichment !  
I remember as a kid growing up in the 80's, a friend had an international visitor, so invited me around so i had the chance to talk to someone from another country, and the person was only from NZ.  
Social media provides and incredibly rich social experience that allows children to grow up connected to the world. Nobody i have seen commenting considers that benefit.  
  
A better way  
Educate young people early, empower them to use technology for their benefit, its the greatest learning tool thats ever existed.  
Go after those profiting from children and others;  
 - There are regulations targeting 'data brokers' in California and EU, that limit how companies can use private information.  
 - The 'right to be forgotten' has been explored in some jurisdictions, forcing companies to delete information they have on individuals on request.

There are a number of studies that show how many hours of time you need with someone in order to form friendships. You can google them if you want to read more but the jist of it is:

You need to spend approximately 50 hours with someone in order to go from acquaintance to casual friend, and then more than 90hours together to move from casual friend to basic friend. In order to become close friends, you need 200+hours together. 

The hours listed here are not proximity or circumstance-based, so simply being around someone (like at work) isn’t enough. You need to spend these hours invested in connection. So this means spending those hours having quality conversations or doing a shared activity where you collaborate and interact closely (so sitting together at the movies doesn’t count, but playing sports or music together does).

AskAnAustralian,social media age restriction Australia,Colombian that feels <lost and unhappy> in Australia / migration,"I've been wanting to write this for so long, but I was just postponing and procrastinating for a great while....I am a male 29 year old Colombian guy who has been in Melbourne since september 2022. I haven't travelled anywhere, just Melbourne, mainly in the CBD area. It's complicated to explain who i feel and perhaps a little bit more what i want, but i'll try to give some introduction of who i am and why i moved here (king of, i'm not an Immigrant, just with a student visa)

Back home in Bogota i was working for a customer service company, servicing customer in the U.S and Canada (a call center agent selling staff)...going back even further in my past, when i wasn't much of smart when it came to the money matter, i unfortunately chose a job that paid more instead of one that helped with my career. Some of you may know that Colombia has a pretty ....pretty low minimum wage (CA. 300$ AUD per month back in 2018), and i come from a very humble background without any connection or contacts in companies or government, so i had to start by the minimum. I was better with english than most of the people I knew, so I chose the bilingual call center as my first job, and stayed there because it normally paid double the minimum wage...Well.. the years went by, and i stayed in that industry, jumping from company to company because it's honestly a miserable industry that burns its employees' minds as much as they can, so personnel rotation in those companies is pretty high. As i, in a way, burned out all my experience in that industry, it became impossible to get a job in my field, which I studied back then in college: finance and international business. i got pretty frustrated by late 2021, and, influenced by a friend that was already here, I decided to come here........i came here when i was 26, one month to be 27...i have done all types of jobs: bartender, busy/glacie in bars, cleaner, labourer, cleaner in construction sides, and carpenter assistant...right now im unemployed....Some of you may know that Colombia is pretty unsafe, poor, unequal, not many opportunities to really grow in life and leave poverty because it's honestly easier to buy drugs than getting education, and especially because the system is made to keep the poor there, being poor, and the real opportunities for the small amount of privileged people (even though i love my land and every time i speak about it, just beautiful words come out of my mouth)back in march 2023 (when i was unsure if i wanted to stay permanently in Australia, or come back), i decided to study carpentry and cert 4 in building and construction....because that career is in the <list of careers that Australia needs or something> and it could eventually give the PR if the whole process is done right... So yeah...Since then I have worked in call centers here in Australia, which wasn't entirely bad, but I had to leave that industry because i was only working 23 hours a week and i was really suffocating with lack of money (because of the work hour restriction to int. students)....so after the call center job i have worked as a labourer and in a bar over the weekends....for some time i really didn't complain. I had to leave the bar job because i was getting extremely tired, and the labourer job eventually turned into an extremely hard job, and that is when I started to get frustrated with my life choices.

i never expected to have come this far, to the other side of the world, to do a job that i definitely don't like, and whoever has been a labourer for some time can agree with me that it's honestly hell if you're not friends of the boss or someone that can make it manageable or bearable.I honestly want to stay in Australia, doing something that i like, but i can't do that because my career, finance, does not give any PR eventually, and i chose already carpentry and building and construction, so i don't have a choice but to stay in an industry that i am finding really hard. Maybe I just wasn't built for that.

On the other hand, I really don't want to go back indefinitely to Colombia. I don't want to be committed to a country as corrupt and unfair as Colombia is, and also where your chances to leave poverty or the middle class is around 4-7 generations (more than 100 years).I see Australia as a place where i can create my own luck and my own hope, here or in Colombia, but while being here, having to stay in the construction industry is making me reach points of frustration and anger i have never experience because of how hard sometimes the work is, to the point of crying sometimes.I feel trapped, i feel that i don't even know the answer to my questions, and i don't wanna have to ask the few friends i have because they would say that i am complaining and continue saying of the millions of people that would give everything to be where i am...I am 30 and i have no idea where my life is going, nor what will happen with me IF i get the permanent resident in Australia. I am also frustrated if I have to go back in my 30s to Bogota and face the chaos of a city that is naturally wild and predatory, guess how wild and predatory it'll be with someone in his 30s starting from zero... I feel that I have made nothing but bad choices only influenced by the money they'll bring in the short term, instead of actually thinking in the future.

I have no social life, not many friends, boyfriends, anything… I may also add that i am gay, but very introvert to the point where i struggle to socialize with people (this is another talk)

What do you think? I know this is a very complicated case, and i have not told my whole experience, it’s way longer than that. The colours and shades of my story are way too complex to be told, and that would make this post even harder to comprehend.What should i do? Should i stay? Should i go back?

Would you consider teaching Spanish? I am a TESOL teacher and your English is pretty good, so you could consider doing a 60hr certificate course in Spanish teaching, as above. 

Then gain two years' experience which I believe is enough if you already have a bachelor's degree in any area. Could also help with your confidence. I'm shy and it really helped me.

Your post makes you sound like you're open to new experiences and you get frustrated when you're not doing that ie you said you tried carpentry, bartending, cleaner, laborer. carpenters assistant and study in business. For many people in Australia, being in your twenties means your first decade of new experiences and finding out all the things you DON'T want to to. The cost of living crisis has influenced more people to stay at home if their family lets them and they can at least focus on the career choice they really want to do in spite of the disappointment of still living at home in one's twenties. 

When you're in your thirties I think you will more likely pick a career you want to stick with. You'll look back on your twenties with a mixture of regret and thrill at how free and fearless you were. Is there any career you really would like to do that you could do better in another city in Australia or overseas?
---
I will say, your experience is not unique, there are many people who go through similar circumstances and frames of mind. You are not as alone as you may feel.

It’s easy to look at your twenties and see all of your “mistakes”, but you would not be the same man you are today without them. You have incredible bravery and resilience moving to a new country, with a language you are not a native speaker of.

I am a big believer of “if you’re not happy, change”, but in this circumstance maybe you’re better off sticking to the plan for the reward at the end, if PR is really the end goal. But if you are truly miserable, there are other career pathways that will lead you to PR and it’s never too late to change.

Others have suggested and I will reiterate, even if you run the gauntlet, use this opportunity to save as much money as possible to set yourself up for the future, surely you could buy a home in Zipa, Chia, Cajica, Sopo (if you want to be close to Bogotá) or even Pereira, Manizales, Cali. The point is, use the advantage you have now to get ahead, whether you rent the home out or move back.

I guess the other thing being said here is move out of the big smoke. Melbourne and Sydney are really expensive. Adelaide/Gold Coast/Brisbane/Hobart are all major cities with relatively cheaper cost of living. This may remove some of the “I need to make [x] amount of money in my career to survive in Melbourne”.

Life’s tough hermano, reach out if you need.

Come to Sydney. It’ll be easier here socially. So many South Americans. 

Financially, it’s a clusterfuck here though
---
I am Colombian and lived in Melbourne almost 5 years, the city need to be experienced in the suburbs not in the CBD area!
Reason is the vibe and interaction with locals totally change, research if easier for you begin by change no city but area.
About jobs and career path only one piece of advice please follow only what you enjoy no what give you money or visa but what give you sense of accomplishment. Need to be something that you love.

Important to get clear what you really want then you think how you will achieve it.

Learn that lesson from me who was also lost.

Parenting,kids off social media,8 year old daughter on social media after I’ve asked her not to use it.,"So I’m in a bit of a dilemma (M28), as the title states my 8 year old daughter soon to be 9 has been using TikTok behind our backs. For context, I’ve been the full time parent of her for the past 3 years. Mom lives in a different state and has her visits scheduled. Current living situation is my 2 sons, her, and my now partner of 4 years. I mention that to say, that a year or so back I found her TikTok and saw messages with random people. Even though they weren’t anything explicit, it highlighted to me the possibility of strangers on there looking for young girls to get to know etc. personally I’m not on any other social media platform other than this for personal reasons. We managed to keep her off the thing meanwhile at my household, but mom not so much as she allows her to use socials and now create content. Fast forward to today, my partner sent me screenshots of a TikTok she created in January posting pictures of herself and her friends recreating some trendy videos using trendy sounds and voice overs. Amongst the post were others however, that I personally found a little distasteful. The biggest one being of her and a boy in her classroom claiming it’s her crush and going as far as to use curse words that she otherwise wouldn’t be saying at home. I’ve expressed my concerns to mom and she seems to be not too bothered by it? So my partner and I are trying to figure out what’s the best way to approach this situation keeping in mind she’s only 8. Overall, she isn’t a bad kid and she doesn’t give too many problems, does good in school and isn’t the disrespectful type of kid. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I understand this whole parenting stuff is hyper sensitive but it takes a village to raise a child and as a man, I don’t feel I have the proper tools to deal with these specific situations just yet as I believe that parenting is growth and development between parent and child simultaneously. Thank you in advance. 🙏🏾

Edit: For further context, in my household she’s not allowed on social media and she’s only allowed a tablet or YT kids monitored by us. Mom got her phone that she gets to use when she visits and that’s where the content is being created.

Why is an 8-year-old having private access to electronic devices that can access TikTok?
---
You are the parent. Those clips are watched by pedos who can chat with your daughter, and get her to reveal what she lives, goes to school, etc

Take ALL electronics away from her. She can't handle it. Tiktok is not a birthright. This is entirely on you to remove the devices.

Don't let peer pressure get to you. You have to be stronger than that.  If the other parents give their children cigarettes and liquor, does that mean you should, too?

I’m a parent with 50/50 care of an 11 year old girl. At my house she is not allowed her iPad or to use YouTube (it’s on the tv and I haven’t worked out how to lock it off) without my explicit consent and I veto content.

She was watching so much garbage and copying stuff and it was hell to get her off it. So I made the call. Not in my house. At all. I found it makes a big difference in her mood and attitude overall.

Her dad has restricted some stuff, but is no where near as locked down as I am. I can’t control what he does anymore, so I have to be grateful that he at least took my concerns on board and made some changes.

Kiddo is slowly working out that different house have slightly different rules (we are pretty much on the same page for most things - I’m just stricter on enforcing and have higher standards) and that what is acceptable in some places is not in others…. It’s a learning curve and she is getting there. 

Also - we’ve both explained that what she is watching isn’t real, it can be unsafe, ALLLLL the things and it just didn’t sink it. At that age extended consequences are a huge concept to grasp. 

You’re doing great - control your circus and your monkeys and try not worry about where you can’t (so much easier said than done, I know). Know you’re doing the best you can, and that’s a huge start!

I believe tiktok has an age minimum rule of 13 (or so ai have read on Reddit, I do not tiktok). Easiest solution here is to just report her account as an underage account to get it locked and she can't get back on.",2024-02-10 08:53:16,False
privacy,social media age restriction Australia,India Enacted a Landmark New Data Privacy Law - But Are Indians Even Aware?,"India made waves recently by finally enacting its long-awaited Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act. This legislation gives Indians unprecedented control over their personal data and restricts how companies collect, use, and share private information.

On paper, the DPDP Act looks great - it's being hailed as India's version of GDPR. But a law is only as strong as public awareness around it. And I worry that, so far, there's been little effort to educate everyday Indians on what this new data privacy regime means for them. (I actually got to know about from this [Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sprinto-com_securewithsprinto-complianceautomation-infosecurity-activity-7137689595210551296-IJsC/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) I really recommend it for an indept understanding of DPDP)

Most citizens likely have no idea about core concepts like data fiduciaries, consent managers, or the rights enshrined by the DPDP Act around data access, correction and erasure. How will they stand up for their privacy if they don't even know what protections exist?

Plus, early indications suggest Indian companies themselves are confused about compliance requirements and timelines. With fines up to ₹500 crore for violations, this lack of clarity could have dire consequences.

The Indian government and civil society groups need to act fast to spread awareness of data privacy rights. Creative social media campaigns, community workshops, even TV and radio ads could help. If people don't even realize their personal data now has legal safeguards, the DPDP Act will not have its desired impact.

What do you think? Is enough being done to spread DPDP Act awareness in India? What more can be done to empower citizens to exercise their new data privacy rights?",55,8,brishere,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/18n1wcr/india_enacted_a_landmark_new_data_privacy_law_but/,2023-12-20 18:43:54,"Beep.

Internet Freedom Foundation India - the equivalent of the EFF in India and foremost digital rights and privacy advocacy organization in the country is at the forefront of trying to ensure India's citizens have a fair and balanced set of digital rights and laws. Unfortunately, most laws are deliberately vague, broad, overreaching and poorly thought out.

There is no debate, since the bulk of opposition members of Parliament have been suspended for ""unruly behaviour"" while protesting and demanding that the Home Minister and Prime Minister respond to a recent security breach in Parliament - the ministers have had plenty of time to give statements to media houses but haven't yet had the time to address lawmakers in Parliament.

Any feedback and requests to refer bills to technical Standing Committees are rejected and laws are just being rammed through because of the government's majority and with zero discussion or feedback being taken on board.

Finally, the vast majority of Indians literally do not care about privacy or tracking. With soaring unemployment, inflation and other issues prevailing, it's the privileged few who are concerned about data privacy, tracking and misuse of digital rights.

Parenting,social media age restriction Australia,13 yo daughter wants to be skinny,"I’m worried about my daughter. Th past year she’s become very focused on her appearance. She draws lots of drawings of extremely thin girls with cheekbones that look like sickly anorexic girls. 

She talks a lot about weight and her jawline. She’s neither thin nor overweight, but very healthy and strong—she does horseback riding and acrobatics. But her ideal seems to be very thin petite girls. She’s more broad-shouldered and built like a swimmer. She’s an awesome kid but she can’t seem to see that. She focuses so much on her flaws lately. And has become so moody!

How do I talk to her about this? 

I’ve tried to tell her that she is healthy and strong  but everything I say is basically garbage in her ears. (Teenage parenting is hard) 
Tanks for reading 

Edit:

Thank you all for commenting. I’m a little overwhelmed by all these responses, but grateful. I’ve carefully read them all and definitely going to look into her social media life. We are already pretty restrictive (she doesn’t have any some platform only iMessage with her friends). we did open up for YouTube lately and that might be one for the culprits. She also often talks about skinny girls at her acrobatics team and compares herself a lot to those. I don’t know the instructors there that well. Might talk to the riding instructor also and mostly just talk to her. And be there for here not judging her.
Will try to see if I can manage to subtly add some positive body imagery around the house!

It's really tricky. I have a daughter of similar build who,  thankfully, was very sporty. She had success on a state and national level and realised that being strong was better than skinny. She also intellectually realised that at nearly 6ft,  she'd never be the little, petite fragile female, but it still affected her self-esteem. Now, at 19, she is slowly coming to accept her version of beauty and focus more on her talents. 

Just talk openly  and point out her strengths without being obvious. However, watch very, very carefully for signs of an eating disorder. There are lots of resources online to find out what to look for.
---
I was this girl. My parents tried very hard to help me, but honestly there was nothing they could have done to change my mindset (which is hard for me to accept now that I have two preteen girls, who I hope don't follow my trajectory). I did go through years of mild anorexia and bulimia, and eventually I came out the other side (sadly, it took a boy to convince me I was actually beautiful...when I was 17. He's my husband now, but I still hate that I needed confirmation from a guy to finally believe what my parents and friends were telling me for years).
I don't know why I felt this way (it all started at 13). I was shy, and introverted, and never felt like I was good enough. I think  I thought that being skinny and beautiful would make me more likeable somehow? 
The silly thing is that looking back on photos, I can now easily see that I was already thin and beautiful then!!! But I couldn't see it at all then.

AustralianPolitics,Australia under 16 social media ban,Voters aren’t just flirting with independents. It’s deep and meaningful now,"**Alex Greenwich, \[NSW\] State MP, April 9, 2025 — 7.30pm**

How many people in your family or workplace make the decisions? Can everyone contribute their ideas and work together to make things better and fairer?

This is how a minority government works, and it is how the NSW parliament has operated for the past four years, under both Coalition and Labor governments.

More and more voters are seeing the benefits. Australians aren’t just flirting with independents any more. It’s much deeper.

I am one of three independents in the NSW lower house who have provided confidence and supply to both sides of politics, and have done so in the interest of stable government and good decision-making.

This federal election campaign, you’ll hear lots of scaremongering about so-called “secret deals with teals and Greens”.

You’ll also hear “hung parliaments” described as chaotic, confusing and ineffective.

You’ll hear these stories because the major parties prefer not to share power. They want to make all the decisions alone, but that’s not the best thing for outcomes or for democracy.

Power-sharing is a stabilising force that helps focus decision-making on evidence instead of party politics.

Here in NSW, we independents simply asked for a corruption-free, transparent, and well-administered government. In return, we got consultation and opportunities to work collaboratively to improve policies. That’s all, and it’s working well, and I have no reason to doubt the same can be replicated federally.

You’ll also hear both sides ruling out working with independents and minor parties. But the truth is, the moment the polls close our phones start ringing with people from the major parties who are “looking forward to working with us”.

When you drill down to most polling, you see this election isn’t a two-horse race, both major parties poll in the 30s in primary votes, with independents and minor parties polling around the same.

This means a third of Aussies want someone else, in addition to the major parties, contributing to decision-making.

If you don’t get a majority of seats, and you only got 30 per cent of the primary vote, it doesn’t feel right that you should then be able to govern entirely alone. You need to work with others. It’s common sense.

In NSW, the broad and diverse crossbench covers regional, metropolitan and suburban seats. While I’m representing inner Sydney, Dr Joe McGirr looks after the Riverina and Greg Piper does the same for Lake Macquarie. It is the same case federally. Non-major party voters are everywhere!

In NSW, here’s some of what we’ve achieved – uncontroversially – by having a seat at the table: fairer laws for renters; banning offshore oil and gas drilling; more essential worker housing; better consultation with regional communities on policies that affect them, and improved public transport options.

Every week in the NSW parliament the crossbench successfully amends legislation and does so with unanimous support.

Through the committee process, we also provide oversight of the bureaucracy and have the freedom to vote according to our conscience on every vote, something that continues to challenge the major parties.

This election will likely deliver a minority government. Power-sharing will be great for Australia: more ideas will be shared, more voices will be heard, and one person or a single party won’t be able to rush decisions or ignore the difficult ones.

Australia has moved beyond flirting with independents. It’s getting serious. That’s because voters have seen power-sharing delivers outcomes.",54,47,Enthingification,https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/voters-aren-t-just-flirting-with-independents-it-s-deep-and-meaningful-now-20250409-p5lqdx.html,2025-04-10 06:57:02,"**Greetings humans.**

One especially commendable feature in the NSW Parliament between both the NSW ALP minority government and independent Alex Greenwich plus other crossbenchers is seeing cooperation to pass private members bills through both houses of parliament and into law.

After all, every MP elected to parliament should have the opportunity to contribute to policy-making, and this can happen when a parliament votes for policies based not on partisan positions, but on merit.

The media focus on the two horse race. But last federal election:

19.5%  voted 1 for a Green or a progressive ahead of the ALP, and

12.4%  voted 1 for a right wing minor party or independent ahead of the LNP.

Dissatisfaction with the two major parties is growing. 

I wish the media had much greater coverage of the full range of other voting options. 

Only 62.5% of those who preferenced the ALP ahead of the LNP voted 1 ALP. I wonder how the non-LNP half of voters would vote if the media told us more about the alternatives.

The problem is when you get the people who hold the balance of power that overplay their hand.  You put a very small minority in that can call the shots.  Some minority governments can work and be good - just be really bloody careful with who you vote for if it's an independent that could hold the balance of power - make sure they aren't the type that negotiate in bad faith",2025-04-10 06:57:02,False
AustralianPolitics,young people and social media ban,Coalition Path to Victory,"I’ve been struck by how circumstances couldn’t have been much worse for Federal Labor this term (excluding a black swan event); cost of living crisis, unpopular referendum loss, energy conversation focussed on costs rather than the environment, domestic civic unrest, and a general feeling that the Government has not done much to address the big issues.

However, few people are seriously considering the prospect of a majority Coalition government. I thought I’d go through the seats to consider whether there is a realistic path to victory. The Coalition need to pick up 21/22 for a majority.

Note: these are musings / quick thoughts rather than in-depth analysis. Note: margins are the estimates by the Tally Room (thanks and credit to Ben Raue), treating proposed redistributions as confirmed.

 

**NT**

We’ll see whether the CLP win takes the sting out of the crime debate. 

Seats potentially in play:

* Lingiari (ALP 0.9%), there was a 4.5% swing to the CLP in 2022. Curious to see what happens in remote communities where enrolment increased for the Voice referendum. The CLP has not yet pre-selected a candidate (if they / she were brave, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price would run).                                                                                              

Possible wins: 1

 

**ACT**

There is a bit of a perverse incentive about having Katy Gallagher as Minister for the Public Service. But even if she hadn’t increased the size of the public service, there would be nothing here for the Coalition.

Possible wins: 0

Cumulative total possible wins: 1

 

**Tasmania**

The only state where the Liberal brand held up in 2022 (3 of the 5 seats had swings in their direction), which may be partly explained by a relatively competent State Government. 

Seats potentially in play:

* Lyons (ALP 0.9%), Susie Bower was pre-selected again (very early in the term). Good community candidate, with experience in local government and higher education.

 Possible wins: 1

 Cumulative total possible wins: 2

 

**South Australia**

As far as I can tell, Labor doesn’t need to worry about an unpopular state government causing a backlash at a federal level. Malinauskas is the nation’s most impressive state / territory leader in my opinion.   

Seats potentially in play:

* Boothby (ALP 3.3%), Nicolle Flint is back and she’s campaigning hard. 4.7% swing to the ALP in 2022, we’ll see if there is any buyer’s remorse.

Possible wins: 1

Cumulative total possible wins: 3

 

**Western Australia**

There will be no McGowan bump this time around but the size of the 2022 swings are going to be hard to overcome. Hasluck, Pearce, Swan and Tangney were double-digit swings, and re-distributions have made some ALP seats safer (Hasluck particularly). Live sheep export ban may buoy Coalition changes in regional / peri-urban seats but most of those are in their basket already. A slowdown in mining may have an impact but we’re yet to fully see the effects.   

Seats potentially in play:

* Bullwinkel (ALP 3.3%), no incumbency benefit and the ALP face twin-Coalition candidates, including Mia Davies (NAT) as a former state member.  

* Tangney (ALP 3.0%), we’ll have a Singaporean born Liberal candidate taking on the Malaysian born ALP incumbent. Interesting dynamic in a multicultural seat.

* Curtin (IND 1.3%), Tom White is a high-powered candidate, will be an interesting contest with money flying around. 

Possible wins: 3

Cumulative total possible wins: 6

 

**Queensland**

Federal ALP will be hoping that Miles’ State Government sufficiently absorbs Queenslander’s frustrations to avoid a backlash. However, at a Federal level, the Sunshine State has been happy hunting ground for the Coalition and as such, there are few seats on offer.

 Seats potentially in play:

* Blair (ALP 5.2%), formerly a marginal seat where the ALP earned a 4.0% swing in 2022. No one pre-selected for the Coalition yet.

* Moreton (ALP 9.1%), also formerly a marginal seat where the ALP earned a 7.2% swing in 2022. Long-time member Graham Perrett is retiring which is likely to help the Coalition.

* Brisbane (GRN 3.7%), talk of former member Trevor Evans returning for the LNP but my suspicion is that these inner-seat seats are beyond the current form of the Liberals.

* Ryan (GRN 2.6%), an interesting three-way contest with all female candidates. LNP candidate Maggie Forrest is the sort of person the Coalition will be hoping to re-attract (young female professional).

Possible wins: 4

Cumulative total possible wins: 10

 

**Victoria**

For the first time in a decade, the Victorian ALP are sufficiently unpopular that people have forgotten that the Victorian Liberals are still shambolic. As we’re only half-way through the term so there is no cover for Albo, particularly as the Metro Tunnel and other infrastructure projects are unlikely to be done in time for the election.

Seats potentially in play:

* Monash (IND), Broadbent quit the Liberals after not being pre-selected. Mary Aldred comfortably won the spot and has solid local credentials as the founding CEO for the Committee for Gippsland.

* Aston (ALP 3.6%), Liberals have pre-selected a local this time who is a solid community candidate (Manny Cicchiello) involved in local school and local government – should fall back into their camp.

* Chisholm (ALP 3.3%), Chinese-dominated Box Hill (which lashed the Coalition in 2022) has moved into neighbouring Menzies. Theo Zographos won the pre-selection unopposed and suddenly the seat is in play. Local councillor but probably not the most impressive candidate.  

* McEwen (ALP 3.4%), the long-time marginal peri-urban seat has been held by Rob Mitchell for over a decade. Not sure about Jason McClintock as a candidate but could benefit from a nationwide swing

* Bruce (ALP 5.3%), one of these outer suburb seats with large migrant populations where the ALP are losing popularity. Marginally swung to the Libs last time (0.7%) so I expect more of a contest this time around. Julian Hill is a solid local member, but Zahid Safi is an interesting candidate (Afghan born self-employed businessman).

* Holt (ALP 7.1%), like Bruce but with a larger margin. Also swung to the Libs last time (1.5%) where both major party candidates will be migrant women.

* Dunkley (ALP 2.7%), Nathan Conroy will have another crack and is likely to run another close contest.

* Hawke (ALP 7.6%), outside chance in the outer suburb seat which swung 2.6% to the Libs last time.

* Kooyong (IND 3.5%), grand-niece of the former Victorian premier Amelia Hamer is the prototypical type of person the Liberals want back in the fold: educated young professional women. It is a challenge when Dutton does not seem as interested / appeal to the blue-ribbon areas and Monique Ryan is a strong candidate.

* Goldstein (IND 3.9%), less yuppy than Kooyong bodes well for the Liberals, but Tim Wilson is divisive.

Possible wins: 10

Cumulative total possible wins: 20

 

**NSW**

The state Liberal division has issues, but Minns’ Government is not overly popular either. I expect the state to feature heavily in the debate (obvious, I know) where the future energy discussion is particularly interesting.

Seats potentially in play:

* Gilmore (ALP 0.2%), Andrew Constance almost pinched it last time with a 2.4% swing. He’ll like his chances.

* Bennelong (LIB 0.1%), notionally a Liberal seat due to the redistribution. Scott Yung is an impressive young (no pun intended) candidate who took it up to Minns at a state-level.

* Robertson (ALP 2.3%), tends to be a bellweather seat for the ALP which the Liberals will be hoping can return to their fold after a 6.5% swing against them in 2022.

* Paterson (ALP 2.6%), there was a 1.7% swing to the Liberals last time, a few different candidates up for pre-selection.

* Parramatta (ALP 3.7%), Katie Mullens is a good local candidate, but Andrew Charlton is an impressive member, even if he is in no way, shape or form a Western Sydneysider.

* Hunter (ALP 4.8%), I’m curious how the ‘future of the region’ debate lands. There is a very real alternative between the nuclear option presented by the Coalition and the off-shore wind being pursued by the ALP. No Nats candidate yet and Dan Repacholi is a fun member.

* Werriwa (ALP 5.3%), another outer suburbs seat which suits Dutton’s brand. There was only a small swing to the ALP last time (0.3%) and Sam Kayal is as a strong community-oriented candidate having another crack.

* Shortland (ALP 6.0%), as in the Hunter. Conroy should hold on but let’s throw it in.

* Mackellar (IND 3.3%), candidate choice will be interesting. I think Scamps is the only NSW Teal at risk (notwithstanding the North Sydney abolition).

* Calare (IND), Nats will be hoping to retain from the defecting Gee. Farraway is a former State member so should have some strong local support.

Possible wins: 10

Cumulative total possible wins: 30

The big picture conclusion is that there is a feasible path to majority victory for the Coalition, but a lot would have to go right. I think those of us who follow politics closely struggle to picture Dutton as PM but I cannot imagine that he’ll be as unpopular as 2022 Scomo. My personal view is that the Coalition will gain ground by 10ish seats.

I’ve tried not to be too optimistic for the Coalition by listing seats like Peace (ALP 8.8%) which could swing if everything goes right but have tended to give them a rosy outlook in places like Holt (7.1%) and Hawke (7.6%). I’m Victorian so I’ve been bolder in predictions there than in other states which I know less well.

One of the key takeaways for me is that, even if they have a good day in the other states / territories, the Coalition need to pick up more than half of their seats from Victoria and New South Wales if they want to get back into power.

Obviously, I have only considered the upside for the Coalition. There are plenty of seats where they’ll be feeling nervous about holding (Sturt, Leichhardt, Deakin etc.).

Feel free to push back against any of the above. I’m no expert.",53,113,Pinoch,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/1f0osj8/coalition_path_to_victory/,2024-08-25 05:05:18,"All I'll say is that Dutton is incredibly unpopular in Victoria. I wouldn't really rate their chances here for more than 3-4 seats. They need to at least retake Aston, Chisholm, Goldstein, and Kooyong; they also need to try & fend off independent runs in Wannon & Monash. Given the shifting boundaries and the elimination of Higgins, which despite being held by Labor was a blue-ribbon seat that the Coalition would have expected to regain, it's not guaranteed that they'll pick up much here.
---
It's a much more detailed picture than what I have personally looked into, however you are assuming a uniform swing solely away to Labor and to the LNP? Including the Teal independent seats, seats that (afaik) once they go no major, they tend to stay that way until said independent retires/flames out?

Greens and some independents will surely offer a better option than the LNP in some spots. 

This also includes a lot of Labor seats in NSW that are likely in the western Sydney area, folks that would be unhappy with Labor about that conflict, but being asked to vote for folks who are pretty much clapping for the meat grinder that is that city, yeah that's a hard sell.

You then also have Victoria voting for (ostensibly) Dutton and his history there, that's also a tough sell.

I think even now, potentially at or just past the apex of people's dislike of Labor, the LNP is still 50-50 or its a super tight 49-51 either way per polling, hence the talk of a slim minority or majority Labor govt, at present pace - though Labor's path to a forced minority govt is very stark, reading through the %'s, yikes.
---
Have Victorians forgot the Vic Libs are lunatics? I suspect we'll see Teals and greens grow a lot more than Libs down here
---
I agree it'd be difficult, but it could still happen. Dutton just keeps playing the negative card and the legacy media just eat it up.
---
You left out Deakin in VIC. Sukkar is a dead man walking. An utterly milquetoast member who has an odious history in Parliament. His margin is razor thin and he should go the next election voters willing.",2024-08-25 05:05:18,False

Parenting,age verification social media Australia,Son being bullied for being a cancer survivor,"My son is a Senior in High School (yes a Senior who is dealing with bullying), recently a group of Juniors have decided they don’t like a friend of his and have therefore decided they don’t like him by proxy.

My son survived cancer treatment and a bone marrow transplant several years ago and a few of these boys are aware because of the friendly relationships I’ve had with their mothers and we live in a relatively small town. Well, as a way to try and humiliate my son and likely try to provoke a fight they have begun sending him messages and shouting “make a wish kid” and “cancer boy” at him. He’s taken it well and was using it as inspiration to finally start the no profit he’s been wanting too, but this week another boy his age in our town died of cancer and now he’s furious and I’m afraid this will turn into a fight if I don’t intervene.

Parenting,Australia under 16 social media ban,My 11 year old participated in online bullying and needs consequences,"Last night I found out about a TikTok account that is targeting specific students at my daughter’s school. The account describes students using discriminatory language and the kids comment guessing who the posts are about. My daughter was targeted by name in one post. I also saw she participated in comments on two other posts. 

Obviously bullying is unacceptable. I took screenshots and sent them to her teacher and principal. She was not supposed to have TikTok in the first place, so I will be making her delete her account. I’m also considering banning all social media, including Roblox. I’m considering taking her phone away for a while, but this is complicated by our custody agreement. Her father lives on the other side of the country and she is supposed to have a phone so they can talk at least three times a week. 

She has never done anything like this in the past, so I’m not sure how hard I need to be on her. I don’t trust her to have any form of social media since she participated in bullying. She also just recently got a private therapist, so I will also be reaching out to them.

at that age, I wouldn't give them a smartphone at all. Just give her a dumb flip phones that can do talk and text and nothing else.

She's can have a flip phone for your custody arrangement. 

No more Internet until she's a teen. It's too much for her.

Look into parental controls to block any apps you want. I use bark, it lets me block any apps and will also scan messages for any signs of bullying, sex or drug talk. She can have the phone to talk to her dad but you could block anything else. I think the natural consequence of not using the internet responsibly is not having access to the internet for a while. When you give it back to her you need clear boundaries and parental control in place, such as blocking social media. 

She's not too young to have a good conversation about mental health and how bullying can affect people. How we can never know what is truly going on in someone's life and sometimes your mean words could be the thing that drives them to hurt themselves. Don't shy away from those hard topics.

AustralianPolitics,age verification social media Australia,Australia is in an extinction crisis – why isn’t it an issue at this election? | Endangered species,"**Some of the country’s most loved native species, including the koala and the hairy-nosed wombat, are on the brink. Is this their last chance at survival?**

**Adam Morton, Mon 7 Apr 2025 01.00 AEST**

Most parliamentarians might be surprised to learn it, but Australians care about nature. Late last year, the not-for-profit Biodiversity Council commissioned a survey of 3,500 Australians – three times the size of the oft-cited Newspoll and representative of the entire population – to gauge what they thought about the environment. The results tell a striking story at odds with the prevailing political and media debate.

A vast majority of people – 96% – said more action was needed to look after Australia’s natural environment. Nearly two-thirds were between moderately and extremely concerned about the loss of plants and animals around where they live.

Unsurprisingly, the cost of living was way ahead when people were asked to nominate the issues they would like leaders to prioritise. But the environment was in a peloton of four issues vying for second place, alongside housing, healthcare and the economy.

On what they would like to see done, three-quarters of respondents said they would back stronger national nature laws, including the introduction of clear environment standards against which development proposals could be measured and potentially rejected.

Any survey should be treated cautiously, but the Biodiversity Council’s director, James Trezise, says it is not a one-off – the results are consistent with the findings of similar surveys in 2022 and 2023.

They are also clearly at odds with where Anthony Albanese ended this term of parliament, with Peter Dutton’s support. After bowing to [an aggressive industry-led backlash in Western Australia](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/27/albanese-kills-off-deal-with-greens-to-pass-nature-positive-law-after-intervention-by-wa-premier) to shelve a commitment to create a national Environment Protection Agency, the prime minister rushed through a law [to protect Tasmanian salmon farming](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/26/controversial-bill-to-protect-tasmanian-salmon-industry-passes-despite-environmental-concerns) from an environmental review.

Longtime campaigners say it meant the term began with a government promising the environment would be “[back on the priority list](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/19/labor-says-it-wont-put-head-in-the-sand-as-it-releases-shocking-environment-report)”, including a once-in-a-generation revamp of nature laws, but finished with existing legislation being weakened in a way that could yet have broader ramifications.

The message from peer-reviewed science is blunt: Australia is in an extinction crisis.

Over the past decade, more than 550 Australian species have been either newly recognised as at risk of extinction or moved a step closer to being erased from the planet.

The[ full list of threatened Australian animals, plants and ecological communities](https://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicthreatenedlist.pl) now has more than 2,200 entries. It includes some of the country’s most loved native species, including the koala, the Tasmanian devil, the northern hairy-nosed wombat and a range of the type of animals that Australians take for granted: parrots, cockatoos, finches, quolls, gliders, wallabies, frogs, snakes and fish. Scientists say that, unless something is done to improve their plight, many could become extinct this century.

Partly, this is linked to a global threat – what is described as the world’s sixth mass extinction, and the first driven by humans. But part of it is specifically Australian and avoidable.

A 2021 government state-of-the-environment report found the country’s environment was in [poor and deteriorating health](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/19/labor-says-it-wont-put-head-in-the-sand-as-it-releases-shocking-environment-report) due to a list of pressures – habitat loss, invasive species, pollution and mining, and the climate crisis. Australia tops global rankings for mammal extinction – at least 33 species have died out since European invasion and colonisation – and is number two behind Indonesia for loss of biodiversity.

In recent weeks, the overriding question from scientists and conservationists who dedicate their lives to protecting the country’s unique wildlife has been: what will it take for national leaders to take the issue seriously? And will this campaign – and the next parliament – be a last chance to hope for something better?

“A lot of people in the scientific and conservation community have found the last three years exceptionally frustrating. A lot was promised, but in the end we went backwards,” Trezise says. “The survey shows there is a clear mismatch between what Australians expect the government to be doing and what it is actually doing. And it found there has been a decline in trust in politicians on the issue, particularly the major parties.”

Over the next week, Guardian Australia’s environment team will tell the stories of passionate people trying to circumvent this in their own quiet way by working to save threatened animals.

This work is most often done with little, if any, government support. One of the findings from the Biodiversity Council is the extent to which Australians overestimate the federal government’s commitment to biodiversity. Most guess that about 1% of the budget is dedicated to nature programs, a proportion that the [Greens have said they would argue for](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/02/australian-election-2025-greens-albanese-federal-epa-environment-adam-bandt) from the crossbench, and that would translate to about $7.8bn a year.

Trezise says that, while funding for nature has increased since Labor was elected in 2022, the reality is that in last month’s budget, on-ground biodiversity programs received just 0.06% of spending – or just six cents for every $100 committed.

Lesley Hughes, professor emerita at Macquarie University and a senior figure in environmental science as a member of the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists and the Biodiversity Council, says it is a “deeply depressing” figure given most people would think even 1% was a “pathetically small amount” to save species from extinction and preserve places they care about. “I do think it shows politicians totally underestimate how much people care about nature,” she says.

She says it is tied to a broader lack of understanding that a healthy biosphere is “our life support system”. “We should treat it as a precious heritage item that is irreplaceable, and we need to see ourselves as part of nature. We are just another species,” she says. “OK, we’re a clever, resilient and adaptable species, but we’ve destroyed so much because we haven’t seen ourselves as being dependent and a part of it.”

The failure to directly address entrenched issues in environmental protection is not new. The singer and activist [Peter Garrett](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/peter-garrett) had first-hand experience of how nature is considered in government decision-making, having served as Labor environment minister between 2007 and 2010. Garrett blocked development proposals more than other environment ministers, but says nature protection was rarely seen as a first-order issue by leaders in government and bureaucracy. He has seen no substantial improvement since leaving parliament.

“That’s a tragedy, particularly given the policy commitments that the current government had when it came into power,” the former Midnight Oil singer says.

“The problem that we have is that, whether it’s at a federal or at a state level – and notwithstanding the best intentions and efforts of environment ministers and \[non-government organisations\] and scientists who advocate on behalf of nature – when it comes to the final decisions that are taken in the cabinet room by political leaders through the prism of economics, nature always comes last. There are exceptions to that, but very few.”

Garrett says addressing that requires a shift in thinking at the top of government, but also across the community. He agrees Australians love nature, but says it often becomes a lower-order issue at the ballot box. It means that while conservation gains are possible – for example, an [expansion in protected areas](https://www.tanyaplibersek.com/media/media-releases/labor-will-save-australia-s-iconic-bushland/) and support for First Nations ranger programs under Labor in this term – they mostly happen in places that no one wants to exploit.

“It’s very difficult in this country to break the cognitive dissonance between us loving our wildlife and enjoying an incredible environment and actually putting resolute steps in place to make sure that it’s protected, even if that comes at a cost,” Garrett says.

Trezise says that is backed up by another finding from the survey – that while people care about nature and want more done to protect it, they have little real insight into how steep the decline has become, or what a biodiversity crisis actually means.

Part of what it means goes beyond what is captured by a threatened species list. It also refers to the loss of diversity within species and ecosystems, including local extinctions of once abundant creatures.

This has become a common story for many Australians who have watched the disappearance of wildlife from particular areas during their lifetimes. To give one example: Brendan Sydes, the national biodiversity policy adviser with the Australian Conservation Foundation, lives in central Victoria. [Grey-crowned babblers](https://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Pomatostomus-temporalis), birds with a curved beak and distinctive cry that are found across tropical and subtropical areas, were common in nearby bush earlier this century, but in more recent years have vanished.

“For us there’s a sort of a continuing discussion of: have you heard these birds recently? And the answer is: maybe they’ve gone, maybe we’re not going to see them any more. And that’s the legacy of fragmentation of habitat and the vulnerability that results from that,” he says. “The same thing is happening with other once common species. And once something’s gone from the area, it’s likely gone forever.”

Sydes says it is easy to become immune to this sort of decline. “It’s become a sort of feature of Australian nature. We really need strong, dedicated action for it to start to turn around,” he says.

How to respond to this is a deeply challenging question. It could start with an end to the government greenlighting the clearing of forest and woodlands relied on by threatened species. The Australian Conservation Foundation found nearly 26,000 hectares – an area more than 90 times the size of the Sydney CBD – was [approved for destruction last year](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/21/threatened-species-habitat-destruction-labor). Under the existing laws, far more clearing than this happens without federal oversight.

The challenge is not only to stop the loss of habitat but to restore the environment in places it has been lost in 250 years of European-driven clearing. Experts say that becomes particularly important in an age of climate crisis, when species adapted to living at particular temperatures and with particular levels of rain are being driven from their longtime habitats as the local conditions change. Connecting fragmented forests and other parcels of nature will become increasingly important.

Laying over the top of this is the impact of invasive species that kill and diminish native species, but are now so pervasive that they have changed the landscape for ever. It means there is no going back to the environment of 1750. A question that the political debate over the environment has yet to fully grapple with is what success from here actually looks like.

The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, raised the idea this term by promising a “nature positive” future, adopting a term that overseas has been defined as [halting and reversing nature loss by 2030 measured against a 2020 baseline](https://f.hubspotusercontent20.net/hubfs/4783129/Nature%20Positive%20The%20Global%20Goal%20for%20Nature%20paper.pdf) and achieving “full recovery” by 2050. It would require retaining existing natural ecosystems – both areas that are highly intact and remnant fragments – and starting immediate restoration work on damaged and lost nature areas.

But achieving that will demand significant funding – whether from public or private sources – in addition to tightening laws to prevent further destruction. Labor passed legislation to encourage private investment, but hasn’t explained how, or when, it will arrive in significant sums.

It is unclear if the “nature positive” tag will survive into the next term given it has been rejected by WA industry, among others. Albanese has again promised to fix the laws [and introduce a different model of EPA](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/31/albanese-says-federal-epa-will-not-be-same-model-as-earlier-one-he-promised-but-didnt-deliver) to that promised this term, but given no details. Dutton says no one can say the existing [environment protection system is inadequate](https://www.peterdutton.com.au/leader-of-the-opposition-transcript-address-to-minerals-week-2024-conference-canberra/) and promises faster decisions to allow developments to go ahead.

In her darker moments, Hughes wonders if anything can change, but she says she remains an optimist. She sees signs of a resurgence in the idea that people need to connect with and value nature as important to the human race, and says it could make nature and species conversation become a higher priority. “Let’s hope that’s the case,” she says.

Garrett says the path ahead for people who want change needs to be “building community and organisational strengths”, and supporting activists prepared to put themselves on the frontline using nonviolent direct action against fossil fuel exploitation and environment destruction.

“It’s about a transformative ethic that lifts what we have and recognises what we have been able to secure jointly,” he says. “It gave us a great conservation estate – look at the world heritage areas, look at Kakadu – but those great gains are in danger.

“Are we going to see unfettered housing developments and oil and gas exploration basically take over every square metre of the continent that’s left for them to do it? Or are we going to draw a line in the sand? It’s time to draw that line.”

I'm a wildlife carer on the Great Barrier Reef so I know how hard it is to educate those who create such destruction because of their ignorant beliefs. 

We fight an uphill battle, especially when we raise awareness for specific indigenous species too many have paralyzing phobias about.

Caring for sick and injured wildlife is expensive, especially omnivorous and carnivorous species when many carers aren't subsidized - they do it because they realize if they don't, more species will go extinct.   
We've had to collect roadkill (fresh) for raptors that need it, so people keep us in the loop if they've seen some

I implore everyone to check in with their local wildlife orgs and get to know what they do.   
Volunteers are always in short supply and so is fresh and live food for animals in care.  
It's something everyone needs to be part of if we are going to make a distance - that includes keyboard warriors who need to get proactive and passionate in other ways. Your local wildlife org will really appreciate the help.

Parenting,kids off social media,How to express concerns to husband about how he handles our toddler when angry?,"I should preface by saying please don't be an arsehole about my husband, myself or my child. Nobody's perfect but we're working on it and that's why I'm here. 

My husband is usually an amazing Father. He works full time from home while I'm on Mat leave and involves himself with our children and often makes us dinner. Since having another baby in September he's involved himself more with our toddler and doesn't give me much chance to look after her. I'm generally OK with that as I know it's only temporary, but he seems to struggle some days and I do wonder why he pressures himself to deal with her when he is not coping well. Her interesting attitude has been, uh, ""flourishing"" for the past year and I'm trying to reinforce consistent, calm and positive discipline but it's difficult as my husband often wants to be involved while I look after our baby and the home. He agrees when I explain the actions we need to take, but doesn't seem to follow through and resorts to shouting and condescending, cocky remarks at our toddler a few times everyday. He ignores me when I ask him not to speak to her like that. I've tried many times.. Everytime I am 100% blanked. Yes, it's very awkward. 

Anyway, a couple of months ago I saw my husband yank our toddler off the sofa by one arm. He dragged her a few metres in the air. I panicked and shouted at him to stop. He made me feel bad for disagreeing with him in front of our toddler over something so petty. I tried to talk to him about it afterward but got the feeling that he was offended. I asked around anonymously on social media, for opinions, and people were generally saying that it was a one off, I was probably suffering from postpartum depression, kid is fine so everything is fine.

Today, during dinner, he lost his temper because toddler was ignoring us when we asked her to eat. He lost his temper very suddenly, stood up, lifted her up one-handed by her humerus and carried her like that across the living room to a timeout, while shouting at her. Obviously she was a crying mess. I panicked and shouted at him to not carry her like that. ""like what?"" he replied. ""by her arm"" I said. And he smirked in a cocky kind of way and said ""it doesn't hurt her"". That annoyed me, because I'm passionate about her talking openly about her own feelings. I told him not to do it again, but he didn't respond. So I asked ""do you see anything wrong with what you did?"" and he mumbled back ""no, not really"". I said ""that's even worse"" and I don't know why but I decided to remind him of a case where he mistreated our cat, throwing her in the air and leaving her to land on our tiled floor (the indoor cat which mysteriously disappeared a few months later). I think I did this to highlight that he has an anger issue. Well, he walked away. Then came back 15 minutes later, happy as Larry as if nothing happened. 

I'm worried where this is going to end up. He obviously doesn't think there is anything wrong with his behaviour and he discards anything I say to him. It also has a huge impact on my trust in him and our solidarity as parents. My toddler could lie to me about Father hurting her and I'd fall for it. 

Am I overreacting? Am I underreacting? Anyone have any good sources of information about any of the issues I mentioned (coping with anger, disciplining challenging behaviour, anatomy of a toddler's arm..)? I really appreciate even just an opinion on this. Thank you!

Edit: yea, thanks for your support guys. For added detail my whole family adore him. My own mother supports him over me when I've confined in her about these (among other) issues. Hence why I'm unsure as f*** what reality I'm in and whether I'm overreacting by wanting to get the kids away from him. You assume I'm an enabler and OK with seeing him do this? I would not write a post asking for advice if I wasnt aware something is seriously wrong. And the preface and politeness I guess is really there so I can be sure to take everyone's comments without a pinch of salt.

I agree with you guys and I get downvotes. Which is twice the mindf*** when a victim of emotional abuse just starts to see reality for what it is and then gets downvoted into oblivion for it.

Anyway, if anyone in London has some advice as to how I can get out of this with no family, friends or money to help that would be greatly appreciated.

What about someone who told you that they sat back and watched their husband *lift a child up by their limb and drag them around the house* because it wasn't as bad as lifting them up and dragging them across town? You should be **horrified** by witnessing this, not looking for excuses why he is a great parent.

He abused your cat then the cat mysteriously disappeared? Did he murder the cat? Are you waiting until your toddler mysteriously disappears? What on earth did I just read?

Get away, get your kids away, then when you're in a safe place where he can not find you, you can call him to discuss his anger issues and abuse towards your toddler.

Sorry you don't want the truth, but here it is. He's a ticking time bomb. Getting frustrated and raising your voice is one thing but he could accidentally break her arm. He needs to lose everything, and deserves nothing.

>I should preface by saying please don't be an arsehole about my husband, myself or my child. Nobody's perfect but we're working on it and that's why I'm here.

I didn't need to read any further - there's a reason why you can't just have a normal conversation with him, and it's very likely because he's also abusive towards you. Please do what you need to do (leave safely) to protect yourself and your child.

>My husband is usually an amazing Father.

It's also funny how people who find themselves in these situations feel a need to defend their partner's actions.

Also: there is no magical spell that is going to transform him from a monster into a decent human being. Accept that this is who he is and protect your child. If you felt it was safest not to physically intervene and use force to try to stop him - that's your own judgment call, but the only reason to lay low and stay safe yourself is to wait until it's safe to leave. If you don't actually leave afterwards.... well, then you're just staying silent because you're afraid and not doing it because it's best for your child.",2024-02-08 21:19:59,False

From Macnamara to Brisbane, the minor party is confident of playing a major role in the probable hung parliament

Mar 27, 20257 min read
When I spoke to Adam Bandt last October, things weren’t looking so rosy for the Greens.

The party had struggled in recent elections, losing seats in Queensland and the ACT. While the situation wasn’t as bad as Labor proclaimed (the Greens’ primary held in Queensland, while Labor’s plummeted), it wasn’t ideal, with the minor party failing to make gains amid widespread disillusionment with the duopoly.

Six months later, with a hung parliament on the horizon, the outlook is starting to look more promising for the minor party. Though a February MRP poll had the Greens losing their three Brisbane seats (leaving just Bandt in Melbourne), recent polls suggest they could hold them all, their steady primary tilting upwards. Why? Partly because women drifting from Labor are turning to the minor party, with female support now at 15%, while almost a third of 18-34 year olds intend to vote Green.

According to one forecaster, Greens may win Macnamara, a three-way contest hinging on who finishes second. The party may pick up Wills in Victoria, where Labor’s margin was halved by a redistribution (candidate Samantha Ratnam is endorsed by Muslim Votes Matter), and climate-vulnerable Richmond in NSW, which has just been hit by floodingagain. The party is running hard in Perth and Sturt, while campaigning to retain the four seats they currently hold.

Bandt constantly emphasises a readiness to work with Labor, following a late 2024 shift in tone. “Industry groups” are rattled (coal advocate Joel Fitzgibbon thinks the Greens are “salivating” at the prospect of a hung parliament), while Labor dismisses claims that progressive achievements during the Gillard minority government had anything to do with the party of Bob Brown.

Bandt, who clearly knew something was wrong last October, says the party has worked hard in recent months to outline its “straightforward social democratic platform,” arguing there’s still “a big beating social democratic heart in Australia”.

“Our candidates have been out and have been out early,” he says, noting volunteers have knocked on thousands of doors. “The more that we talk to people and tell people what our plan is, the plan that we’ve been outlining now for a while, the more they’re responding to it.”

Perhaps the biggest change since last year is the return of Donald Trump, and the chaos that has ensued. Bandt says Labor has failed to relieve people’s economic pain — something the far right feeds on. 

“Part of why we are pushing this social democratic platform so strongly is that we think it’s an antidote to the rise of the hard right,” Bandt says. “If governments actually use their power to make people’s lives better and deliver on the basics like housing, healthcare and food, then it removes the discontent that the likes of Trump and Dutton feed on.”

Trump is no doubt in the Greens’ talking points — which is not to say this isn’t also true. The Trump factor is raised by both candidates I speak with, Brisbane MP Stephen Bates (the party’s most likely loss) and Macnamara candidate Sonya Semmens (perhaps its most likely gain).

Bates believes there’s been a Trump-related vibe shift, benefiting not just Greens but independents too. The millennial MP says constituents regularly raise the US, and “how much they don’t want us to go down that path”. It rings true for Bates, who got involved in politics after working (and being exploited) in America, and recognising the need to protect Australia from the “creep of Americanisation”.

“People feel very overwhelmed with what’s happening in the world,” he tells me. “[We’re] trying to give people that bit of hope that things can be different, and can be better, and that we’re going to be the party that walks the walk and doesn’t just talk the talk.”

Bates won his seat off a Liberal, but some forecasts now put Labor as favourites. Are progressives turning to Labor out of fear of a Coalition government?

“People are definitely concerned about the threat of a Dutton government, 100%,” Bates says, noting it’s often mentioned in the same breath as Trump. But he thinks Brisbane voters understand voting Green keeps Dutton out, having had him in for the past three years.

Bates, who is gay, is running ads on Grindr, echoing his last campaign, with slogans like “YOUR STRONG LOCAL MEMBER” and “THE BEST PARLIAMENTS ARE HUNG”. He reckons there is hunger for a hung parliament.

“People are so over the status quo,” he says, adding many in his seat don’t think Labor deserves another majority, having failed to make bold changes with the current one. “This was Labor’s chance the last three years to prove that they could do more than what they said they were going to do on the tin … It just didn’t happen.”

Down in Macnamara, Semmens also raises the spectre of Trump, when asked how this campaign differs from her last (Semmens ran for the Greens in now-abolished Higgins).

“We called that the climate election, and it was very anti-Morrison,” says Semmens, who has been doorknocking Macnamara for more than 12 months. “This conversation is about what it means to have hope for the future, which is super existential, in the light of what’s happening in America — which in the last month started to come up on the doors. People have this sense of an existential threat that they can’t quite put their finger on.”

Renter-heavy Macnamara was tight in 2022. With a primary split three ways, it took weeks to declare Josh Burns the winner, with the real battle between Labor and the Greens for second (third place’s preferences will almost certainly help second overtake the Liberal in first).

An expected decline in Labor’s vote could see Semmens overtake Burns, winning on preferences. The Herald Sun worries this is exactly what will happen, demanding Labor put the Greens last. Ironically, Jewish voters (the seat is around 10% Jewish) moving from Labor to Liberal could be what pushes the Greens in front, though Semmens is hesitant to make that analysis. 

Israel-Gaza is clearly a sensitive issue, one Semmens says she takes very seriously.

“It’s certainly in my mind and heart because I have a lot of Jewish friends and so it’s perhaps one of the most tragic personal experiences that I’ve had campaigning,” she says. “I feel a great sense of sorrow about where that narrative is and what I think the representation of the Greens’ perspective has been by the media and other interests. On a personal level I feel really frightened for my friends who are Jewish who have a negative experience of being Jewish in the community.”

Semmens mentions a graffiti attack on the business of her friend Yaron Gottlieb, and the fact there were recently neo-Nazis on the Elwood foreshore. She says the Greens will be matching funding from Labor and the Coalition to rebuild the firebombed Adass shul.

“I think we need to go all in supporting the Jewish community… It falls on me, I think, as the candidate and perhaps the representative of this community to try to repair the relationship and rebuild the bridge that has been broken. And I will feel that weight of responsibility.”

As for whether she is “salivating” for a hung parliament, as Fitzgibbon so viscerally put it?

“I would say I don’t salivate for much that isn’t food,” she quips, before turning to the benefits of a hung parliament.

“What we have here as a parliament is an opportunity to show voters that we can be bigger than our own political interests and that we can genuinely be for the people of the people to work together across the aisle,” she says. “That will mean some sacrifices on all parts and maybe a big spoonful of humility for people. And you know what? As a 46-year-old woman I am super comfortable with humility.”

All this door-knocking, all this Trump-related angst. It begs the question: why aren’t the Greens doing better than they are? And what will it mean if the Greens don’t progress this election, or worse, go backwards?

Bates, who may yet lose his seat, says it won’t be the end of the Greens, which will likely still hold the balance of power in the Senate.

“We’re still going to be here because there’s still the existential crises that need addressing. There’s still climate change that is going to happen. The housing crisis, cost of living, everything that is going on in the world … We’re still going to be here and we’re still going to be fighting to address them because if we don’t do it, it is very clear that the major parties are never going to.”

The Greens are their own worst enemy. They seem to want to pick a fight about *everything*, even when it's obvious that they cannot win. Worse, they often come across as being contrarian for the sake of being contrarian. The net effect is that nobody takes them seriously when it comes to the actual issues they want to campaign on or which they have a valid point to make. As such, they're stuck in limbo, unable to win seats beyond the inner cities where the most progressive voters live.",2025-03-29 21:44:19,False

You're thinking about it wrong.  They all change, all the time. 

Don't think about which one is worth it, because even the morons who say X or Facebook are dying, are wrong - all that matters is íf it works for you.

Focus on what you'll consistently, effectively, and naturally do.  You can't fake that and you will burn out from disappointment when something you don't do well doesn't work.

I don't like doing videos.  And everyone who says everyone should do video is an idiot.  I don't do video well.  Period.  

When you nail that, then just focus on results.  If it works, do more.  If it doesn't, stop. 

Someone's biased and personal experience is going to mislead you; no one else can tell you what will work best for you.

I think Youtube is #1 when it comes to community but it also the most difficult one to be succesful. 

Tiktok is like fast food, quick dopamin hits for viewers and creators, huge visibility and inflated numbers. Followers do not matter at all though. It´s all about appearing on peoples FYP consistently. 

Meta products are more and more pay 2 win. I have had great success this year on Instagram but I know a lot of people struggle with the algorithm.

(b) I've been infantilized all my life and I feel very bad for the new generation of young man who will be even further degraded and treated as pure little dolls to shield from reality well beyond their actual biological growth into Tanner stage 5.

(c) It's a sign of the ""protect the childrens!"" movement taking even more power. This movement ruined my life. When I was 12, and I first started to get consciously horny, I was told that I shouldn't have sexuality because I'm a Minor(TM), so I started self-harming every time I had sexual thoughts. I managed to beat the sexuality out of me but now I'm a bitter, socially-stunted loner. When I was 16, I was accused of child sexual abuse for ""shipping"" the wrong two *Steven Universe* characters. People wanted me dead.

(d) Censoring people's speech doesn't protect them. More ownership over young people is not for their own good. You can't spend your entire life worrying about potential isolated incidents of kidnapping/murder/rape and use those as the yardstick with which to live. Taken to its logical conclusion, nobody would ever interact with anybody, ever, because they COULD be dangerous. We are breeding an entire generation of bitter, violent loners like me.

(e) To enforce the age restrictions, there will be massive privacy violations (every website that allows communications will require an ID database, which will inevitably leak and create a national if not global security crisis). I'm tired of being a suspect.

and

(f) The murder of Ms. Ghey had nothing to do with ""social media"". She was murdered by two classmates, from school, who personally knew her, face-to-face. It happened in real life, not online. The argument the censorious bastards use is that the killers in this case had social media. Ban ""social media"", and killers will use letters. Ban letters, I guess?

""Someone aged 16 was murdered. We must ban all people of her age from communicating because her killers also used said means of communication."" It seems very much to be shooting the messenger.

Imagine, the first time a 40-year-old man was ever murdered, we as mankind collectively agreed to ban all people aged 40 and under from speaking, since the man and killers spoke. The newspapers can surely see the logical hole?

Now, whenever I see children, I feel violently angry inside. It's not children's fault. It's the fault of the political concept of ""children"". Every one of my human rights that let me exist as who I am will eventually be thrown out the window in the name of ""the children"".

In fact, my mum and dad started dating around ages 16 and 21. My dad would have been crucified if it were today. I would never have been born, with the popular belief that humans transform literally overnight on their 18th birthday from a toddler into a dirty old man.

The thing with being treated as ""just a child uwu"" at 17 is that it leaves you woefully unprepared for the reality of life when you do hit the magic 18. The system doesn't let you grow up. It actively stops you when you try, and then it's all ""you're 18, why haven't you grown up?"".

I concur.

The reality is that they are first banning social media for under-16s, and then, for under-18s. 

They don't understand we have enough restrictions on youth? We DO NOT need anymore restrictions! Why talk about social media restrictions? In the last 10 years, I have met numerous youths who use social media.

All of them are still alive today and are in their 20s; some of them have hit their early 30s. They are alive and well. 

First, it is 16.

YouthRights,young people and social media ban,The internet is a fundamental human right for children.,"There are some people who would disagree with me, especially educators and caregivers, but it's the truth. The internet is widespread technology that holds the power to information, free speech, and innovation, which children have the fundamental right to have and access. It is an important suppliment in today's world for emotional communication, learning, and real life. But unfortunately, there are many who are against social media because of how they believe it has bad effects on (what they mistakenly believe) the vast majority of the people. These are the type of people Mike Males and I like to call ""social mediaphobes"", or ""technolophobes"". These technolophobes are the ones who support the banning of the internet and social media for all children, especially those under the age of 16 (See Australia's recent social media law).

One of their dominant reasons for this is that they believe the internet (mostly social media) deteriorates a young person's mental health. However, researcher Mike Males finds a reversal to this claim. Rather than the simple equation that most technolophobes respond with -- kids + constant technology use = bad mental health, Mike Males considers a better equation that is usualy more accurate than the former: kids + bad mental health = constant technology use. Technolophobes fail to consider the external causes behind a young person's mental health issues. In most cases, it's not the technology, but rather things like unfortunate circumstances, governmental issues, family problems, school, etc. Forcing a kid offline will not solve their mental health problems. In fact, you may be isolating them from the one thing that brings them hope, peace, and tranquility since the technology is responsible for creating new connections, communications, and introducing solutions to problems.

This brings me to another point. Internet and social media use can serve as a safe space for a lot of kids. Kids with abusive families, emotional issues, questions, or concerns about society, life, etc, can benefit heavily from internet use, where they can ask anybody questions, or search up the answers to their questions. This is a human right I believe kids ought to have, especially research, no matter how taboo the questions a kid may have. By stripping a kid from a powerful tool that can ready them for their future, you are not only violating their right to resource and connection, you are violating their basic human rights and their freedom to speech and expression, and giving them a huge disadvantage in education and knowledge. I hope the future generation of parents and educators can see the error of having to trap kids in a box, completely isolating them from the internet and social media. I hope they can see that educating a kid about technology is much more powerful than having to isolate them from their basic human rights.

In the case of youth, there are extra challenges involved in terms of what they're *allowed* to do. The cinema might be accessible, yet they need their strict parents' permission to leave the house; they'll never be able to afford it because they can't work and rely on their parents' income; most movies available are harshly rated to try to please overly sensitive adults, so a majority of the interesting options aren't even open to them.

When you restrict a young person's freedom to a point where they aren't allowed to do anything outside of scheduled monitored activities, of course they're going to spend most of their spare time sitting on their phone. What else is there to do?

AustralianPolitics,Online Safety Amendment Act 2024,Labor’s grassroots environmental group dismayed by rushed bill protecting salmon industry | Australian politics,"**The Labor Environment Action Network says it won’t ‘sugar coat’ its reaction after working ‘so hard’ on obtaining commitment for EPA**

Labor’s grassroots environment action network has told its members it does not support legislation that [Anthony Albanese rushed through parliament](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/26/controversial-bill-to-protect-tasmanian-salmon-industry-passes-despite-environmental-concerns) this week to protect salmon farming in Tasmania, describing it as “frustrating and disappointing”.

In an email on Thursday, the Labor Environment Action Network (Lean) said it would not “sugar coat” its reaction to a bill that was introduced to end a formal government reconsideration of whether an expansion of fish farming in Macquarie Harbour, on the state’s west coast, in 2012 was properly approved.

Albanese had promised the amendment to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act to protect salmon industry laws in the remote town of Strahan after internal warnings the issue was damaging Labor’s electoral chances in the Tasmanian seat of Braddon, a seat the Liberal party holds on an 8% margin.

An environment department opinion released under freedom of information laws had suggested the reconsideration could lead to salmon farming having to stop in the harbour, while an environmental impact statement was prepared.

Lean’s national campaign organiser, Louise Crawford, told the group’s members the passage of the bill with bipartisan support on Wednesday night was “not an outcome we support”.

“It is one of those incredibly frustrating and disappointing moments as a Lean member,” she said in an email seen by Guardian Australia. “We have all worked so hard on getting the commitment for an EPA \[Environment Protection Agency\] and environment law reform for such a long time when no other party was talking about it nor interested in it.”

The reconsideration of the Macquarie Harbour decision had been [triggered in 2023 by a legal request](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/nov/07/tasmanian-salmon-farms-could-face-restrictions-to-save-endangered-fish) from three environmentally focused organisations to the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek. The request highlighted concern about the impact of salmon farming on the endangered Maugean skate, an ancient ray-like fish species found only in Macquarie Harbour.

The new legislation prevents ministerial reconsideration requests in cases in which a federal environment assessment had not been required and the development had been operating for more than five years. It was welcomed by the Tasmanian Liberal government, the Australian Workers’ Union and the West Coast Council that covers Strahan and surrounding areas.

The government has dismissed conservationists’ and environment lawyers’ concerns that this meant it could be broadly applied beyond salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour, arguing it was “a very specific amendment” to address a flaw in the EPBC Act and that “existing laws apply to everything else, including all new proposals for coal, gas, and land clearing”.

Crawford said Lean believed it was a “tight set of criteria” that did not apply to most major projects, including coal and gas operations, or to most developments that involved significant land-clearing. But she said the advocacy group would have preferred a solution that allowed the salmon farming to continue while an assessment was carried out.

“We do not think activities should be immune from reconsideration if evidence shows they need to be given a federal environmental assessment,” she said. “This underlines the importance of completing the full environmental reform process, and to having an independent regulator.”

Crawford urged members to “dig deep” and resolve to help Labor craft improved laws and an EPA in the next term of parliament “despite what happened this week”. She asked them to [campaign for a group of pro-nature Labor MPs who Lean has named “climate and environment champs”](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/22/eight-labor-climate-champions-to-get-election-help-from-partys-grassroots-environment-action-group) – including Ged Kearney, Kate Thwaites, Josh Burns, Jerome Laxale, Sally Sitou, Alicia Payne and Josh Wilson – so that the environment “has strong voices in caucus and the parliament”.

She noted Albanese had committed to reforming environment laws and creating a federal EPA in the next term after shelving both commitments in this term. “This is Labor policy so should be delivered no question. We will continue to work to deliver this. It’s time. It’s more than past time,” she said.

The Maugean skate has been [listed as endangered since 2004](https://nre.tas.gov.au/documents/Maugean%20skate%20-%20Listing%20Statement%20-%20Final.pdf). Concern about its plight escalated last year when a government scientific committee said numbers in the wild were “extremely low” and fish farming in the harbour was the main cause of a substantial reduction in dissolved oxygen levels – the main threat to the skate’s survival.

The committee said salmon farms in the harbour [should be scaled back](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/15/tasmania-salmon-industry-macquarie-harbour-maugean-skate) and recommended the species be considered critically endangered.

A separate [report by the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies](https://www.utas.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/1795799/2014-2024-Macquarie-Harbour-Maugean-skate-population-status-and-monitoring-report.pdf/_nocache) last month said surveys suggested the skate population was likely to have recovered to 2014 levels after crashing last decade. It stressed the need for continued monitoring.

Like I get that environmentalism can be fraught for Labor. People working in industries like logging, farming, mining etc fear for their jobs. And no one, especially Labor's traditional base wants carbon taxes or fuel taxes or meat taxes, or for the cost of living to go up due to environmental policies.

But this seems like a time when they should have sided with the environmentalist side. Macquarie Harbour is in Braddon and it is very unlikely that Labor will win back Braddon, long term northern Tasmania is trending away from Labor. It is dubious whether this could swing Lyons. 

No one outside of Tasmania gives a fuck about salmon farming, so its not like there'll be a backlash against not protecting salmon farming throughout the country. The progressive wing of the party is upset and this could swing votes and seats to the Greens. 

This is bad politics.
---
Labor left has been dead since 2019.

Negative Gearing? Climate change goals which are actually ambitious? Giving a shit about environmental issues like salmon farming in Tasmania?

Nowhere left for voters who were sold on that vision in 2019 to go to now but the Greens. People give Chandler-Mather a lot of credit for last election's ""Greensland wave"" but imo the bigger reason is Labor 2019 making people think progressive values are good, and then Labor 2022 promptly abandoning those values.

They left a policy gap, and the Greens swooped on in to pick up stuff like negative gearing as their own policy platform.

YouthRights,social media age restriction Australia,"Age of consent, sexuality and age gaps relationships : we are not ready for this conversation","For a long time I thought about writing on this topic. Sometimes I hear people say things similar to ableist rhetoric, which is very prevalent in our society. I said that I would write a thread on this topic, here is why **we are not ready for this conversation**.

Prepare yourself, it will be very long.

First of all, we CANNOT have this debate as long as adult supremacy is a thing. Talking about consent in oppressor/oppressed relationship is akin to debating whether slaves could consent to sex with their masters without abolishing slavery! The issue is that young people are literal slaves. Yes, I dare to use this word.

They are property of their guardians, barred from civil, social and political life. They are locked away into a prison-like artificial environment called school, where they only get to interact with people who are the same age as them – or close in age – and a few adult wardens (we call them ""teachers""). They are barred from voting, pressing charges, getting out of their homes, and all the other things like that.

Even incarcerated felons in the US don't have as much restrictions as them! Yet the only crime of those young people is their date of birth.

However, the same dynamics existed, and still exist in many parts of the world thanks to colonization, between women and their husbands not so long ago (being property of a husband not – always – of their choice), yet we did not ban sex between men and women. Marital rape was even considered as a part of being married, and of course it was almost, if not totally, impossible for women to escape.

Yes, marriage is dangerous for women, but nobody thinks of barring men from marrying them. Instead, we focus on the social constructs making it dangerous. Without patriarchy, I would not even be writing this paragraph.

Why don't we have the same reasoning regarding youth rights? Because the ones who were harmed by adult supremacy now benefit from it. From someone who suffered CSA to other people, especially the ones who were harmed by adult supremacy: **Why do you enable the system that allowed you to endure that? Why do you think it is okay to do to others what has been done to you? Why do you view youth liberation as predatory?**

You will ask me: ""What about grooming?""
I'm coming to this. To groom young people, you don't have any effort to do : society does 99,9% of the work for you! From birth, we are told to obey ""grown-ups"" no matter what. We are told we are ""just children"" not knowing what is good for us. Therefore, someone else decides for us and we have to comply or else. We are told we are dumb, our brains are undeveloped (many posts on this sub debunk that) and real world is too complicated for us.

If we dare to say no, we are punished, tone policed ("" don't talk back to me"") and reminded of our inferior status (""I'm the adult, so I know better than you."") or diagnosed with autism, ADHD or ODD (Oppositional Defiant Disorder, aka drapetomania rebranded), depending of your gender and skin color. If we call out double standards, problematic or abusive behavior or just contradict adults, we are silenced, gaslighted (""You are too young to understand it properly"", ""You think this way because of your hormones"", ""No, you don't want that even if you think you do"") and told to stay in our place. If we dare to know ""too much for our age"", we are silenced and told it is a sign of abuse.

When you are conditioned to obey no matter what, what happens when someone from the oppressor group wants to have sex with you and you don't want? More often than not, you do what you are told. Grooming works exactly like cult recruitment : you crave something you need (agency and not be the property of someone else), however your surroundings don't provide it to you. You are provided the exact opposite (being micromanaged and stripped from your agency and rights).

One day, a person uses what you need to lure you into becoming their puppet. In many cases, you know there's something wrong but you are choosing between plague and cholera, when your initial situation was not worse than your current one.

By the way, telling someone they are mature for their age is not always predatory (it is more complicated than this). It shows that adult supremacy is ingrained in our society to the point where knowing about politics at 13 (for example) is seen as being ahead, in other words, mature. It shows that everyone think of minors/slaves are brainless idiots who don't know a shit about anything apart from the last New Balance sneaker loafers.

Telling a person that they are ""mature for their age"", regardless of their age and your age (even if they are older than you) is NOT a compliment. It is an ageist fake compliment. Saying it is akin to saying to someone from India that they ""speak English very well [for an Indian]"" or ""You're intelligent for a woman."" to a woman. Everyone would agree that saying such things is racist and misogynistic. Why don't we consider ""You're mature for your age"" ageist?

All those sentences have one thing in common : they reduce entire groups of people to a monolith, thus stereotyping them. Claiming that women are too delicate for important (read: men's) topics is an example. Claiming that young people are too innocent to hear about important (read: adult) topics is another one. It is a form of bigotry.

To come back to the ""You are mature for your age."" compliment, the saddest is when you are told this sentence by a person younger than you. It means they internalized anti young people bigotry. But the way, we should learn about ""learned helplessness"" because it explains so many things.

Many people say that restrictions imposed by guardianship and minority status is mostly a protection ""Ok it is frustrating, but it is for your own good. You'll understand when you're older and you'll be thankful.""
Thinking so is extremely naive. People use the exact same arguments to justify stripping women from their rights in Saudi Arabia. And we all know that it does not protect them at all.

Do you sometimes wonder what you would have done during Jim Crow era or in a male supremacist state? It's likely you already do it.

To come back to the main topic of the post, AOC and sexuality will be one of the last things we will talk about within YL movement. As George Sand wrote, ""First, emancipation from our fathers and husbands and only then we will be able to talk about vote [for women].""

In Youth Liberation it is something along the lines of :
 First, emancipation from our parents/owners and abolition of parental rights and minority

Then, civil rights and laboral rights (meaning the right to choose whether to go to school or not)

Then, any other issue aside from sexuality

And only when adult supremacy will not be enforced by laws anymore and young people who defy the orders will not be diagnosed with ODD anymore, we will be able to start thinking about sexuality and everything around it

Regarding predators and pedos, even if they try to shoe horn themselves into youth liberation, they don't want that. YL is not in their interest since it's adult supremacy that enables their actions. And even then, discourse about sexuality is not about actual children (pre pubescent people) since they have, by definition, no sexual desire of their own. We also need to talk about the artificial extension of childhood, since adolescence has no biological basis (it's not real actually). 

Finally, the only mature people (aside from the biological definition, aka puberty) are dead people.

EDIT: For more information on how childhood and CSA are concept built by oppression (making CSA separate from regular SA allows people to think of it as something that is not a structural issue somehow), I advise everyone to read this well-sourced text I just found: [Why are you kidding?](https://immerautonom.noblogs.org/files/2023/04/Kitzinger.pdf)",45,11,Sel_de_pivoine,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/1clu2es/age_of_consent_sexuality_and_age_gaps/,2024-05-06 21:03:11,"I think we can have this discussion, just as long we remember how incapable adults are exploited. People don't ask questions that would protect incapable adults from being harmed. For example, people can witness a power of attorney even if they believe the person isn't capable of making it. There was actually a requirement for witness to believe the executor was capable of making it, but it was repealed. There's also a failure to prevent people with authority from coercing them. There are to few restrictions on what people with authority can do. Many people with authority can do things they shouldn't be able to do. Nothing is stopping a religious councilor to coerce an incapable person to sign a power of attorney, or a therapist to coerce their patient into making their attorney be someone, just as long as its not them. It is very easy for SDMs to use force even when its illegal. No one asks enough questions for them to be held accountable in most cases. 

However, it's important to remember that age and capacity are not linked and people can capable in some areas and incapable in others.

We need to recognize that coercion is a factor and people must actual have reason to believe that a person is capable of consenting.

Super W post, however, I will remind that perpetuating the moral panic against paedophiles and equating all of them to just predators as if you couldn't like someone younger aside from being young (and viceversa for some youth as well, remember) is in itself a major barrier that prevents the whole movement and society from moving forward and rationally addressing how we approach all of it, as it is often straight up misinformation that is spread to fuel a moral panic and justify protectionist intervention.  But alas, as you said, this point of mine, is also something this movement is not ready to tackle.  Curious reminder, it is topics like these which led to ASFAR to eventually be no more (putting aside some of us who are trying to revive it while emphasising what you said and what I have addressed above to prevent the youth liberation movement end up like it's 2nd wave).

I literally just looked up the phrase ""You're so mature for your age"" and lots of people are realizing that it's such a problematic phrase. They don't yet realize that it's not really a compliment in that it doesn't lift the person on the receiving end up but rather puts everyone else in the person's age group down, but they realize two things. First is that it's a grooming tactic meant to flatter younger girls. Second is that it can downplay the trauma from having to take on the role of an adult when none are available.

I strongly agree with everything you said. Other relationships have the possibility of being dangerous yet it’s only applied to age gaps. Yes age gaps can be risky but so can other relationships like you said. And I hate when people say that young adults are not adults or are not mature because they haven’t had much experiences when elderly people tend to have more experiences than middle aged people yet no one seems to say that the middle aged people are not adults or are not mature because of that. Plus more experiences won’t always make you mature.

AustralianPolitics,young people and social media ban,MEGATHREAD - HAMAS forces launch an assault on Israel,"It's very clear that this event is of interest to Australians, but very limited relationship to Auspol directly. So this megathread is an opportunity to discuss the unfolding attacks on Israel, similar to what we did with the Russian aggression against Ukraine last year.

A few housekeeping rules:

1. No anti-Semitism, no Islamophobia. Bans will follow.
2. Absolutely **no** glorifying or calling for violence. That's a reddit-wide rule. **We** will ban you *and* serve you up to **admins** on a plate for a site-wide ban too. Just *don't*. 
3. If you *have* to link to graphic images or videos, and I mean it's necessary for the discussion and not just for emotional weight or shock value, then **make sure you put clear and visible tags on it** so people who wish to avoid trauma, can. 
4. Whataboutisms are lazy. Avoid them where you can (i.e. Rule 4)
5. Finally - this is a monstrously complicated issue. It just is. You can take my word for it, I spent 5 years covering the MidEast and terrorism in my under- and post-grad degrees, and stay current on it. If you think there's a ""simple"" answer, or ""simple"" fix, assume you've cut yourself shaving with Occam's Razor.   
**In other words, don't be afraid to ask**. Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and to remove all doubt, as Abe Lincoln once said, and finally
6. Some media outlets, like the CBC, have resisted the urge to call the HAMAS fighters ""terrorists"". Whilst I think the initial attack was terrorism, it's morphed into ""guerrilla insurgent ethnic cleansing"", which just rolls off the tongue. But, we're not prescriptive - if you want to call it terrorism, insurgency, guerrilla war, ethnic cleansing, or some or all of the above, that's ok. Just don't refer to any side as pejoratives. International law might be in trouble here; Rule 1 is fine and dandy, thank you very much.

I can’t understand people cheering this. It’s not just evil, it’s also completely harmful to the Palestinian cause. This action will make things 10x worse for Palestinians.

Am I wrong? Maybe someone can explore to me how these acts are going to advance the cause of the Palestinians.

Deliberately killing civilians is evil, no matter what your cause is.

Although I'm not up to speed anymore, I suspect this is a power play by Iranian proxies using Israeli and Palestinian lives to achieve certain geopolitical aims.

Currently the Sunni Muslim world is coming to a rapprochement with Israel. Iran and the Shi'a world are getting isolated. 

The horrendous attack on Israel will result in a horrendous attack on Gaza and perhaps elsewhere. Sadly, I assume that's been factored in by the planners of this attack. 

In the Arab world it's not cool to sit by and let others attack your neighbours, even if you detest those neighbours. Ages ago I was in Jordan on an Aussie industry promotional gig (under Hashemite royal protection) when Israel assassinated the disabled 70+ year old leader of Hamas with a helicopter rocket attack a few dozen kilometres away. Normal everyday people reacted angrily. They thought Hamas were dicks but this was just wrong. 

I wonder whether this kind of reaction is what the master plan predicates. 

A far right Israeli government voted in on security certainty fails, utterly, to defend the country. So they are provoked to do the unthinkable, to reassure their constituents. And Israel has a visceral need and right to defend its own. What worries me is that response could be anything. And then there will be an outraged global response to that...
---
I think there's a clear difference between a civilian and a military target. 

And Hamas just killing civilians has given the Israelis every excuse possible to justify a war. 

People whom see Hamas as the good guys for shooting unarmed civilians need to be called out as the morons they are. 

Same with the IDF bombing civilian infrastructure. Killing civilians. 

Taking a side and bouncing around, placing one on a pedestal is just plain wrong. 

Two wrongs don't make a right. 

Killing unarmed civilians even if you believe them to be 'settlers' is wrong, even if they indeed are settlers, just murdering for the hell of it is wrong. 

Now if the settlers were indeed armed, posed a threat, then yes. They're no longer civilians, they are combatants. 

Yes, Israel is a authoritarian fascistic regime, but on the other hand is a group of radical authoritarian islamists of which are attacking unarmed people with full knowledge and intent that they indeed are unarmed.

I think some social media is harmful. That doesn't mean I think the government is a good judge of what social media is harmful. The laws being passed to restrict kids' access to social media are wrong. Parents also get it wrong when they restrict children's access to the internet for fear of their child developing an independent worldview.

The deeper issue is that, while social media can sometimes be re-appropriated into a positive space, the infrastructure has been appropriated by private companies looking to make money, regardless of who gets hurt. When the infrastructure has been molded to that purpose, turning it to another purpose becomes messy and difficult. Eg. TikTok has been a positive space for political organization, but also a space where a lot of misinformation is spread and where harmful behavior sometimes gets normalized for clout.

And no, I'm not in favor of the TikTok ban, either. It's hypocritical to ban it when Facebook is as bad or worse on the things it's being scrutinized for.

There are predators that use the internet to find victims. It's true that children are more likely to be victimized by someone they know, but when kids are increasingly turning to internet communities due to the lack of physical spaces they're allowed to be in, that ""someone they know"" can be someone in an online space. And because everything is about profit, platforms are designed only to limit the liability of the platform owner, rather than to truly protect the people who use it.

If you think social media harms by itself, you probably also think rock and roll is the Devil's music, sad movies cause teen suicide and violent games cause violence.  You are wrong.

The phone ban at school is bullshit, yes. I agree with that. But i think that the laptop restrictions are caused by more things than just the need of control. For example, i remember my classmates in high school. They were always given a task to complete during a computer science lesson. But instead of learning how to use excel, they played some shitty browser game and got an F. Then, there is the risk of some harm done to the software of a laptop. I had some acquaintances that loved to mess with the school computers, net and what not. And i imagine it was so annoying to have to call the IT expert to fix the problems done by these students almost daily. I know nothing is truly gonna stop some people, but a massive pc protection that is harder to get around may discourage a lot of people, as it would take more preparation. Moreover, at least here, its also normal to get a laptop with many restrictions from your employer, if your job requires working on a computer. I think a school is very similar. So, although i am mostly against it, i can see some reasons and i wouldnt say its neccessarily adultism either (the phones are, though).

AustralianPolitics,social media age restriction Australia,Federal election 2025: Peter Dutton stokes fear of recession in response to Trump tariffs,"**Memo Dutton: Good economic managers don’t try to panic the punters**

**Ross Gittins, Economics Editor, April 14, 2025 — 5.30am**

A problem in economics is that you can’t use the economy to do experiments. But as economists realised some years ago, sometimes the economy presents you with circumstances that constitute a “natural experiment”. This happened last week, and Peter Dutton flunked the test.

In the days immediately after Mad King Donald’s [big tariffs announcement](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lopx) on “Ruination Day”, sharemarkets[ around the world were crashing](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lpjl), people were feeling panicky and no one was sure what it meant or where it would lead, except that it sounded very, very bad. As usual, the media wasn’t helping.

Treasurer Jim Chalmers and his boss, and[ Reserve Bank governor Michele Bullock](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lqpl), were doing their job, trying to calm everyone down – acknowledging the great uncertainty, but trying not to add to it.

Treasury had done some initial modelling, and though it looked bad, it didn’t look that bad. Bullock and her boffins had thought hard about it and decided we’d weather the cyclone without too much damage. Certainly, we were well-placed to withstand the buffeting. (Translation: the Reserve had plenty of scope to cut interest rates if necessary and unemployment was unusually low.)

So how did the leader of the party claiming to be the best at managing the economy react? He should have resisted all his instincts as a good economic manager to join the authorities and help put out the fire, and just kept his mouth shut.

How did Dutton react? He thought: “You little beauty, here’s my chance to put the frighteners on. I’ll go for it.” So he stoked fears that a recession was imminent.

Asked if Australia was heading into recession, he replied, “it is under Labor” and “the government hasn’t prepared our economy”.

Elsewhere, he said: “We know that Australian families have lived through almost two years of household recession. That’s what Labor has already delivered during the term of government.

“The treasurer is talking about a 50-point reduction in interest rates, which means obviously he sees a recession coming for our economy.”

With that performance, Dutton has disqualified himself from high office. He’s been a cabinet minister for decades, but still hasn’t learnt – or doesn’t care – that people at the top don’t use the R-word until the numbers on the board leave them no choice.

He doesn’t know that. When people in high office speculate about the likelihood of recession, confidence is further damaged, which risks making their predictions self-fulfilling. Individual commentators like me, however, can say what they like without anyone taking much notice.

Despite his bachelor of economics, Anthony Albanese has taken little interest in the economy, but at least he knows what not to say. Dutton’s problem is his Superman complex. He sees himself as responsible for saving us from the rising tide of crime and pestilence that besets us.

His powers allow him to see what we can’t: the roaming African gangs keeping Melburnians trapped in their homes, the women in supermarkets with machetes being held to their throats.

This is how he knows he can do a deal with Trump that Albanese can’t; he can save us from the recession that’s inevitable under Albanese. He doesn’t need to know the details of economics because he has kryptonite to do his heavy lifting.

Note that Dutton’s shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, hasn’t joined him in his fearmongering. Taylor is a qualified economist of good repute. His trouble is that, not having served an apprenticeship in a minister’s office, he can’t play politics at a professional standard. He can’t tell lies with a straight face.

He wouldn’t have resorted to the muddled thinking Dutton used to justify bandying the R-word about. Dutton thinks Chalmers’ self-serving prediction of imminent hefty interest rate cuts is proof a recession is coming. It doesn’t occur to Superman that, if rates were cut sharply, the objective would be to forestall a recession. Is he implying that he could prevent recession without cutting rates?

It’s true that, thanks partly to high rates (but also an earlier fall in real wages, and massive bracket creep), consumer spending has been weak, so that only strong growth in the population has kept gross domestic product struggling on. Many have said this means we’ve suffered a [“per-person recession”](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lh05) for the past two years.

But let’s get real. And let’s not be misled by the money market and media-promoted nonsense that two successive quarterly falls in real GDP constitute a “technical” recession. Why is it that sensible people live in fear of recessions and responsible political leaders never use the R-word until they have to?

Well, it’s not because GDP has fallen backwards for a couple of quarters. What can take a bit longer to appear is the consequence of a significant fall in economic activity: falling employment and rising unemployment. It’s the sight of thousands of people losing their jobs, the fear you may be next, and the knowledge that it would take weeks or months to find a new job, that scares the pants off normal people.

So if we’ve been in “per-person recession” for two years, what’s happened to the jobs market in that time? Total employment has risen by more than 750,000, the proportion of working-age people with jobs is almost the highest it’s ever been, and the rate of unemployment has crept up just 0.5 percentage points to a still-amazingly-low 4 per cent.

Does that sound like a recession to you? It’s the complete antithesis of a recession, which is why the Reserve has been so reluctant to cut interest rates.

In this campaign, there’s been far too much whingeing about the cost of living with almost no acknowledgement of one fact that should have all of us thanking our lucky stars: our jobs market has never been better. Almost everyone who wants a job can find one – or more than one.

In all Dutton’s efforts to convince us life is insufferable, and it’s solely Albanese’s fault, there’s been zero mention of our tip-top jobs market. In all our self-pity, we’ve allowed a man with no interest in the economy, and little knowledge of economics, to mislead us.",43,36,Enthingification,https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/memo-dutton-good-economic-managers-don-t-try-to-panic-the-punters-20250413-p5lrb1.html,2025-04-15 05:17:45,"**Greetings humans.**

He's a real piece of work Spud. 

Peter Dutton thinks if it rains, its Labor's fault. Old mate doesn't want you to remember his Coalition were in Government 3 years ago. What did they do to ""prepare"" the economy for an unprecedented global shock, from a lunatic President in America? Nothing, because if the markets had saw this madness coming, they'd have prepared for it. Not lost trillions of USD in capital, with some people watching their life savings evaporate in hours. 

Peter Dutton has no plan for Australia. All Peter Dutton can do is play wedge politics. How about he blame his mate in the United States before shitting all over our country, for the 20th time. 

The Coalition do not deserve your vote. Their Trump style politics is downright UnAustralian.

Good article. I agree. He tried to play the fear of a recession and it played straight into Albanese's hands. Like, there is already a lot of noise about the Trump factor on the election, and I'm sure a lot of think pieces after the election will talk about this, assuming the current trajectory holds, but to what extent can he be blamed and to what extent is it's the Dutton campaign's incompetency?

Like, yeah people don't like Trump, they are afraid of what Trump will do to the Australian economy, but Dutton did not need to steer into the fear, he chose to. He didn't need to say on numerous occasions late last year and early this year that the Trump admin will be a good thing, he didn't need to copy a bunch of Trump concepts like DOGE, he did not need to have a raft of Trump-like or Trump-lite policies. Every time he, the campaign or some member of his shadow cabinet CHOSE to do this. 

You could say if he didn't escalate he'd fade away and lose regardless, which might be true, but which is better doing the best you can in an election you know you will lose, having a more dignified and principled defeat, or continuing to escalate and have each desperate attempt make things worse?

When the starting gun went off TPP was on average tied at 50-50. There's another version of events here where Dutton doesn't escalate and maybe hold Labor to a minority. Instead, within 3 weeks we now have almost every poll pointing us towards a Labor majority and a Coalition caucus room that gets smaller, not larger. That takes some doing.

It's worth mentioning again, if as the polls currently suggest, Labor forms a majority with a net zero or net gain in seats, that is the single worst performance by a first term opposition in the history of the Federation. If by some wild chance they lose Dickson too, it'll be bedlam.

AskParents,age verification social media Australia,I read my son's diary. What do I do?,"My son is almost 9 — he’ll turn 9 in about three months. He’s been keeping a diary for a few months now. I’ve never read it until recently because I didn’t want to be *that* mom who snoops into everything.

But over the past few days, he’s been acting a little secretive about it — always checking if I’m watching, being very careful about when and where he writes. He even asked me multiple times whether I’d ever read his diary. That curiosity started eating away at me. I know I shouldn't have, and I already feel awful about it, but I ended up reading a few pages.

And now, I can't stop thinking about what I read.

He wrote about a girl in his class he has a crush on — let’s call her Jennifer. He said she’s really pretty and that he really likes her. Then, a few entries later, he wrote about a boy he saw at his swim lessons — let’s call him Jake. He described Jake in such vivid detail: blonde hair, blue eyes… and how they made eye contact. He said he wanted to kiss him, that Jake was very pretty, and that he felt confused between Jennifer and Jake.

The part that really stuck with me was when he wrote: *“I like Jennifer better because it’s more reasonable, but I love Jake romantically.”* I am clueless as to what he meant by that sentence. What does he mean by it's reasonable to like Jennifer more? Is it because he thinks a boy having a crush on a girl is normal? Also, I am honestly shocked that he knows words like ""romantically"". Where the hell did he even learn a word like that?

He’s only 8. I know that. And I’m trying not to read *too* much into it. I don’t care whether he ends up liking boys, girls, both, or neither — that’s really not my concern here. Is it common for an 8-year-old to say they like both boys and girls? I’ve always known I was straight, even as a kid, so I’m just trying to understand how young kids experience and express these kinds of feelings. Curious to hear from others who’ve seen this with their own kids or from folks who remember feeling this way when they were young.

What’s getting to me is how intense his feelings already seem to be. At his age, I had silly crushes, but I wasn’t thinking about kissing or romance in this kind of way. It’s making me wonder: is this normal for an 8-year-old? Is this level of emotional intensity typical at this age?

I’m not judging him — I’m just… surprised. A bit overwhelmed. And honestly, a little sad that he’s already navigating such big, complex feelings.

Please don’t tell me I shouldn't have read his diary — I already regret it deeply. I wish I didn’t know, and yet now that I do, I would like to get some advice on how to approach this. I cannot bring this up to him as then he would know I read his diary. He will never trust me again.

She recently testified of a traumatizing incident at age 11 years. I sympathize with her, but cannot stand her bullying, condescending, bitter attitude as well as her rudeness and the fact that she readily insults this subreddit in general. 

I am not sure why our sub is tolerating promotion of the Teen Brain Myth. I believe that Rule 4 is clear that Adultism is NOT tolerated. 

Yet, [First\_Beautiful\_7474](https://www.reddit.com/user/First_Beautiful_7474/) is a 38-year-old woman who is constantly pushing adultism and accusing us of being children. She relentlessly pushes the nonsense that everyone under 25 years old is a child and needs restrictions from adults. She has a rude, condescending attitude and has an anti-youth sentiment. 

I thought we had a strict rule against such posts. Yet, this woman has posted such nonsense countless times on this sub (for weeks straight). 

Do we have a policy to ban such people from this sub? Because this sub is for youth advocates, not youth bashers, and especially not for those who promote the myth that under-25s has immature brains, let alone the nonsense that our sub lacks critical thinking skills. 

[First\_Beautiful\_7474](https://www.reddit.com/user/First_Beautiful_7474/) has a negative attitude towards young people and accuses our generation of lacking critical thinking skills. If that is her attitude, why is she still allowed to post on this sub? 

Funny how she accuses us of lacking critical thinking skills when GENERATION after GENERATION does things that are plainly wrong, immoral, or stupid such as footbinding (practiced for centuries in China), slavery (practiced everywhere), and other stuff. 

Name a generation that DOES have critical thinking skills. You can name none.

Boomers and Gen X gave us this (USA):

- Trillions of debt

- Autocratic leaders (Bush, Obama, Biden)

- War on Terror

- 2 wars (failed)

- Mass spending

- Government spying (PATRIOT Act)

- TSA and air travel restrictions

- Department of Homeland Security

- 2008 recession

- No Child Left Behind

Cevin Soling has a ted talk on this ""the truthiness of school"" Dr. Peter Gray publishes articles on the ""suicide"" data on psychology today and the doc ""the war on kids"" mentions it too, fact is we live in a world where numerous societies actively go out of their way to support and enforce something which leads to annual child genocide and the culprit of it is so normalised and conditioned into us as a ""good"" we can't bring ourselves to admit it's doing this for the same reasons we don't when conditioned to think anything is a ""good"", remember lot's of people couldn't bring themselves to criticise the catholic church for what they did due to the same reason (socialisation), which by the way was because of schools too, they'd help all of it massively and got zero blame for it.

Now they are just mass murdering people not just molesting them (although research has shown both are common) and won't get blamed for the murder's just like they didn't the molestations cause of normalisation, look up how horrifyingly common these suicides actually are, it's a pandemic.

AustralianPolitics,young people and social media ban,"Governments are addicted to gambling revenue, with pokies Australia's greatest weakness","Despite the harm posed by gambling — particularly pokies — governments remain addicted to the revenue.

Jason Murphy

Australia is gambling addicted, and this applies to governments as well as gamblers. On gambling, we spend more than any other country across the entire world, with pokies our sore spot.

The motivation for controlling pokies is that they harm people more than other kinds of gambling. The biggest category of harm from gambling is damaging relationships. A lot of divorces follow from problem gambling. You can ban kids from pokie areas in pubs and clubs, but you can’t exclude them from being caught up in the harms of pokies.

A major problem with pokies is that they meet the needs of the addicted. They differ from a lottery, where you can play only once or twice a week. Pokies can be played whenever you want, for hours at a time, with the machines optimised to hijack our dopamine systems and make us want to give them another spin — and then another.

Who falls into this trap the most? The people who can least afford it. As the next chart shows, spending on pokies in Victoria is associated with socio-economic disadvantage. The places with the lowest scores spend the most on the pokies.

The big difference between gamblers and governments is that for governments, the payoffs are positive and predictable.

As the next chart shows, Australia’s three most populous states are pulling in generous flows of pokies revenue. New South Wales makes the most, while Victoria is now in second place after a recent surge brought it ahead of Queensland.

Gambling revenue is a mainstay of state budgets. It accounted for nearly $3 billion of the expected 2025-26 revenue in Victoria’s budget, brought down yesterday. That sum is growing, even though pokies revenue is actually one of the slower-growing categories in the state budget, with lottery revenue growing the fastest.

The moderate growth of pokies revenue in Victoria is a policy decision. The state has introduced some of the country’s strongest pokie control laws, with players able to put in only $100 at a time, and new machines required to spin 40% slower than the maximum speed permitted on old machines.

“Almost 30% of Victorians who play gaming machines experience gambling harm,” said Victorian Gaming Minister Melissa Horne earlier this year, when she announced the new rules.

The policy path Victoria has taken seems appropriate, having reduced pokie spending per capita. Inflation-adjusted, Victoria’s gambling spending is the same as it was in the late 1990s, despite a booming population. This suggests policy can work.

However, for policy settings, you really can’t beat the approach of Western Australia, where pokies are banned outside casinos. As a result, pokie spending at pubs and clubs per capita is recorded as zero, and in 2022-23, per capita gambling spending was $4,500 compared to $13,500 in Queensland. The WA state government seems to do just fine without huge pokie revenue.

Gambling taxes account for just 1.3% of the revenue flowing to Treasury coffers in central Perth. The federal government does not compensate for that policy with higher GST distributions either. The capacity to raise gambling taxes is assumed to be equal across all states on a per capita basis. Indeed, part of the reason for Victoria’s recent budget challenges is that pokie revenue has declined following the tighter rules.

Pokies spending is a crummy way to raise revenue and drive economic activity. If pokies are shut down, problem gamblers will spend their money in the economy anyway. And if they’re paying rent and buying food for their families, the government may well find a lower amount of social problems it needs to mop up later.

Shutting down pokies is a good idea, but we need to be vigilant that sports betting doesn’t just replace it. The ability to play 24 hours a day on a highly accessible device on an app full of flashing colours and blinking lights makes sports betting just as rich an addiction as the pokies. It is already becoming the next big frontier for gambling addiction.",41,17,CommonwealthGrant,https://www.crikey.com.au/2025/05/21/gambling-revenue-pokies-government-tax-australia/,2025-05-21 05:37:08,"**Greetings humans.**

The federal government could include proceeds from gambling in the CGC/GST calculations.

It'd be a whole lot less desirable for governments to have large gambling tax revenues, if it hurt their GST proceeds.

State governments that are addicted to gambling revenue are part of the problem.

And then they'll turn around and complain that productivity isn't improving?  Yeah, because amongst other reasons, billions are being siphoned out of the pockets of those who can least afford it, and their families suffer because of that.

I'll note that if the eastern states fixed their pokie problems (and took steps to ensure that sports betting didn't replace it) they'd probably save a lot of money that the social problems it causes are costing them.

Parenting toddlers and little kids is a bit like being the designated driver for your best friend at a club. It’s loud, you’re tired, but you made a promise to keep your friend safe and they are having the time of their life and that attitude is infectious. You find yourself dancing along to the music and putting out small fires as you try and keep your friend from drunkenly hurting themselves. Part of you wants nothing more than to curl up in bed and go home, but the other part is having a blast and enjoying spending time with your friend.

In my opinion, the hardest part of parenting is having to step out of your comfort zone for the sake of your children. I have anxiety with social situations, but I have to speak up to help facilitate play dates and such for my kid. I have to be able to call or go up to another mom and plan play dates and whatnot. I have to be able to confront the doctor, teacher, or whoever if I think my child isn’t getting the proper treatment. I have to be able to advocate for them in ways I wouldn’t advocate for myself. I have to do things I really don’t want to do so I can model healthy behavior for my kids. 

I think the staying up all night to change diapers and making bottles is the easy part. Getting up at 3am to clean puke off the bedroom floor? That’s the easy part. Its not fun by any means, but it isn’t uncomfortable like speaking up is. And I’m sure not everyone can relate to this, but it was the biggest thing for me to adjust to. I want what’s best for my kids, so that part comes naturally. And I WILL throw down if someone is threatening their health or safety. But saying “hey no I actually need this done for them” is difficult for me.

Having a newborn infant is hard. You are exhausted all the time, and have days when getting to have a shower is a major victory, but you figure it out, and it gets better as the weeks & months go by. 

Then, you figure out how to live your life with your kid. There will be less late night adult partying, and more impromptu dance parties in your kitchen. Trips will include more kid-friendly activities and the joy and delight that comes when you see your kid blown away by things they’ve never experienced before. You’ll go out to eat earlier so you can beat the rush and be home in time for bedtime routines. And once your kid is a little bigger, you’ll have Supernatural marathons with them, and then be secretly delighted a year or two later when you catch them re-watching the series on their own (true story).

There are highs and lows in parenting. Every year and every development stage has its own challenges and delights, but in most cases, once you’re in the thick of it, you wouldn’t trade it for anything else.
---
You'll figure out the partying and traveling. That is by far not the worst part. 

The worst part is basically having to act like a manager 24/7. You can't show anger at your employees (kids), always act respectful and professional, keep things in order, assign lunch/snack/nap breaks, micromanage the newbies (toddlers), have the teenagers on an action plan, make sure the maintenance is kept up, make sure the kitchen and cleaning is stocked, linens, group activities, doctor appointments....

AustralianPolitics,do teens need social media,"Federal election 2025: Why Peter Dutton, Anthony Albanese campaigns are the worst I’ve seen","**This election is one of the worst I’ve seen. Here’s the one thing we can do to fix Australian politics**

**Ross Gittins, April 14, 2025**

How are you going with the election? Are you getting a lot out of the debate, seeing the big issues canvassed and making up your mind who’ll win your vote?

It’s not as if the choice isn’t clear: do you want to wait 15 months for a permanent tax cut of $5 a week, rising to $10 a week a year later, or would you be eligible for a $1200 once-only tax cut in July 2026, plus an immediate one-year cut of 25c a litre in the price of petrol?

If that’s not enough to seduce you, there’s more. Anthony Albanese will cut the price of draught beer by 5¢ a glass for two years or, for small businesses, Peter Dutton will make entertainment expenses tax-deductible (conditions apply).

But you may want to judge it on the character of the leaders. Again, the choice is clear: do you want the controlled, experienced hand of Albanese, who’ll never do anything rash, whose goals are modest and whose motto is “steady but slow”? Got a problem? He’ll think about it. If you want a prime minister who’s on everyone’s side, Albo’s your man.

Or do you want tough cop Dutton on the beat, always quick on the draw and ready to protect us from the threatening world we live in? He’s heard of a supermarket worker who’d had a machete held to her throat. That won’t happen to you on Dutto’s watch.

And it’s not as if the campaign so far hasn’t been action packed. We’ve had [Albanese falling off the platform](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5louu) at an election rally, then denying it. We’ve had Dutton joining a kids’ football game and [hitting a cameraman in the forehead](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lpex).

What would a campaign be without seeing pollies in safety helmets and high-vis vests on TV every night? Or at a childcare centre, showing how human they are and what good fathers they must be whenever they can make it home?

What’s new this time is Greens leader Adam Bandt taking a big red toothbrush with him to TV interviews (must have some meaning I’m missing) or his colleague waving round a bleeding headless salmon in the Senate.

What’s that? You don’t think much of the election campaign? It’s been neither interesting nor edifying, and hasn’t got to grips with the big issues?

Well, I agree. I think both sides are treating us like mugs. Maybe like the mugs many of us have allowed ourselves to become.

In my 51 years as a journalist, this is the 20th federal election campaign I’ve observed at close quarters, and I’m convinced they’re getting worse: more contrived, manipulative, transactional and misleading, and less focused on the various serious problems facing us, which are far greater than they used to be, and now include America’s abdication from leadership of the free world.

In short, election campaigns have become dishonest, aimed at tricking us into voting for one side rather than the other, using trinkets to distract us from the bigger issues that neither side has thought much about nor has any great desire to tackle.

I know that’s easy to say for an oldie like me (77, since you were too polite to ask). “It was much better in my day.” But though things weren’t great in the old days – we’ve never been a paragon of Socratic debate – I think they’ve got worse over the years, and I’ll try to show how they’ve got worse and explain why.

But I must say this: even if things in Australia have got worse, they’re not as bad as they are in many other countries, [particularly the US](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5loy4). Nor are they ever likely to be.

Three things protect us from other countries’ decline. First, [compulsory voting](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5a79a), which forces everyone to register a choice and pay at least some degree of attention. Second, preferential voting ensures the person who wins is the one most of us prefer.

And third, an independent electoral commission which regularly increases the number of electorates and redraws boundaries to ensure there’s roughly the same number of voters in each, and these have boundaries that aren’t gerrymandered to give one side or the other a built-in advantage.

This is in [marked contrast to the US](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5kkf5), where each state government determines its own federal voting arrangements. Their gerrymandering ensures they have very few marginal electorates, whereas we have a lot. And we don’t have voting arrangements designed to disadvantage certain classes of voters, such as racial minorities.

So we shouldn’t complain too much. Even so, our election campaigns have changed over the years, and not for the better.

They’ve changed because [the voters have changed](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5la56) – Gen Z seems a lot less interested in conventional politics than we Baby Boomers were at their age, when there was so much disapproval of Australia’s part in the Vietnam War, and so many young men (including me) hoping not to be conscripted.

Another important source of change is technological advance, particularly the effect of the information revolution, which has armed the parties with greater knowledge of voters’ views, and changed the media by which politicians reach out to voters.

Finally, the political class’s changing aspirations have affected the way campaigns are run. In the olden days – even before my time – politicians used to travel round, visiting key electorates and talking to voters. They’d do this at evening public meetings or, during the day, from the back of a truck in the main street.

But the advent of television changed all that. While local politicians and their supporters may canvas their electorates door to door, most contact between the party leaders and the voters occurs via TV.

These days, leaders still visit marginal seats around the country, but what they do during the day is aimed at producing the colour and movement that will get them a spot on the evening TV news – hence helmets and high-vis.

They’ve worked up a list of promises to announce, and they (and their media entourage) go somewhere vaguely relevant to deliver the announcement. Guess where they go to announce a change in childcare?

A big advantage of this is that their busy day ends late afternoon, once the TV news camerapeople have got what they need for this evening. Then the leaders can go to a fundraiser, appear on a current affairs program, or get an early night.

Trouble is, though the pollies haven’t changed their routine, the evening TV news bulletin isn’t nearly as universal as it was. When there were only four channels, all airing their news at the same time, if you wanted to watch telly while you had dinner, you couldn’t avoid the nightly news bulletin.

Now the proliferation of TV choices makes it much easier to avoid the news, which many do. The parties have started using social media to spread their messages, but this makes it harder for the rest of us to see what they’re up to.

As the proportion of people who don’t follow the news – and aren’t much interested in politics – has grown, the parties have had to reach them via advertising. They now spend a fortune on TV ads, with far fewer ads in print and on radio. My theory is that, for the many people who don’t follow politics but know they’ll have to vote, they do their last-minute homework by remembering the TV ads they’ve seen.

But advertising works by appealing to our emotions, not our brains. Don’t explain the details, just make me feel nice – or angry. The parties know negative ads – attacks on their opponents – work better than positive ones (“you’re gonna love my policies”), which is hardly a boon to the democratic process.

This is what has made fear campaigns – misleading people about how badly they’d be affected by the other side’s planned changes – so fearfully effective. And the increasing resort to fearmongering is a major way by which election campaigns have become less informative and more misleading.

So it’s not just the way the mechanics of campaigning have changed. More importantly, it’s the way what’s said has changed, and the way the politicians’ objectives and behaviour have changed.

Politics has become more professional. In former times, politicians tended to be men (yes, almost all of them men) who turned to politics after a career as a lawyer, businessman or union official. They’d wearied of making money and decided to spend the last part of their working life fighting for a cause.

I’m sure personal ambition has always been a big motivation for getting into politics, but in those days, it came mixed with a strong desire to make the world a better place. These days, politics has become a career path you follow for most of your working life.

When young people are interested in politics and would like to make a career of it, they get started as soon as they leave university, taking a job working for a union, or in a minister or opposition minister’s office. The number of people working in ministers’ offices has grown considerably during my time in journalism.

It started in the Labor Party, but then the Liberals joined in. You work your way up the ladder, first aiming for preselection as a parliamentary candidate. Once you’ve made it into parliament, you work towards a job as a minister or shadow minister, then see how far you can make it towards the very top.

Such a career path teaches you a lot about how the political game is played, but not much about how government policies work best in the interests of the public. It tends to replace any initial idealism with pragmatism and cynicism. It tends to feed ambition.

These days it’s rare for politicians to enter politics later in life. Two exceptions were the Liberals’ Dr John Hewson and Malcolm Turnbull. Both were hugely intelligent, and both cared about good policy, but both had trouble playing the political game at the professional level and didn’t survive at the top. Labor’s exception was Bob Hawke. His great success at the top came from all the politics he’d learnt while rising to the top of the union movement.

So when the barroom experts assert that most politicians care more about their personal advancement than about doing good things for the nation, I’m inclined to agree. As someone famous once said, “by their fruits ye shall know them”.

The professionalisation of politics is a main reason that what’s said and done in election campaigns has changed, but another reason is that politics has become more scientific. In former days, politics was played by ear. Pollies decided what voters liked and didn’t like from what the voters they met said to them, then used their own intuition to fill in the gaps.

These days, the parties spend a lot of money conducting private polling, not just of how people intend to vote, but what issues are more important to them at present. They also use carefully selected focus groups to get ordinary voters expressing their views on particular issues.

When someone says something and everyone round the table says “yes, that’s right”, the professionals running the group take note and pass it on to the pollies for them to use. Or it can work the other way: the pollies and their people think of lines to help sell a policy measure, and they’re tried out on appropriately chosen focus groups. What goes over well gets used in public utterances.

Between the careerism and the carefully gathered knowledge of what voters think, election campaigns have become more contrived. We’re transported to a fantasy land, where everything is nice and nothing is nasty (except the bad guys on the other side).

The pollies never try to tell a voter something they don’t want to hear. They never tell a voter they’re wrong about anything, and seem to go along with anything you may say, no matter how silly.

Have you noticed the way politicians expect us to be – and encourage us to be – completely selfish? It simplifies their job. They tell us what they can do for us and our families, never what we should be agreeing to in the interests of the country.

And the more they talk about doing this little thing or that little thing for us – the more they make following elections good preparation for a trivia quiz – the more they avoid having to talk about a host of big but controversial issues: climate change, the environment versus jobs, AUKUS, school funding, online gambling and even uninsurable homes. Of course, I couldn’t swear the media had played no part in dumbing-down election campaigns.

The pollies always tell us about the various nice things they plan to do to make our lives better, and never tell us of the not-nice things they’ll have to do to improve our lives. In election campaigns, every player wins a prize.

Not so long ago, a big part of elections was pollies being pressed to tell us exactly how much their promises would cost and exactly how they’d be paid for.

But doing that is what caused Labor’s Bill Shorten to lose the 2019 election he was expected to win. He had some expensive promises, but spelt out some small tax changes that would cover their cost.

These changes had been carefully selected to hit only some well-off people who could afford the loss, but the Libs ran a scare campaign telling ordinary punters they’d be hit and, with the effect magnified by a lot of yellow and black ads paid for by some fat Queenslander, Shorten lost enough votes to cost him the election.

The trouble here is that politicians on both sides have broken so many promises and said and done so many tricky things for so long that many voters have concluded they are all liars. This is why so many people have stopped listening to them.

But there’s one exception. The only thing a politician says that the doubters are prepared to believe is that their opponents are not to be trusted because they’re out to get you. “Ah yes, ain’t that the truth.”

That’s why scare campaigns have become the currency of election campaigning, with stultifying effect.

And that’s why the 2019 election has made elections and their campaigns much worse than they were. Under Albanese, Labor vowed never to be caught like that again. He made himself a “small target” at the 2022 election, promising to do very little, and not to do many things: introduce new taxes, increase existing taxes, and cancel or change the already legislated stage 3 tax cuts.

Apart from the latter, he’s kept those promises. He’s been a small-target prime minister, doing as little as possible to tackle our many problems, which is why so many of us are so uninspired by his performance. It’s far too risk-averse.

A leader who’s not game to do anything unpopular – such as putting up taxes – is a leader who’ll never make much progress solving our deeper problems, like giving our youngsters a fair shake, and never improve the future they profess to care about so much.

Trouble is, under our two-party system, when one side takes a position, the other side almost always copies it. We get less choice, not more. So when Albanese decides it’s safest to stay small target, Dutton stays small target.

When ditto Dutto keeps changing his policies mid-campaign, we’re watching him learning on the job not to be daring, not to fix things and, above all, to be only superficially different from the other side.

The big change since the 2019 election is that neither side will ever have the courage to propose any kind of tax change that would have some people paying a bit more – even those who could easily afford it. The tiniest possibility of an increase for some, and the fearmongers on the other side will soon have taxpayers throughout the land shaking in their boots.

This has taken the election-campaign fantasy land to a whole new level of unreality. The laws of economics have been suspended for the duration of the campaign. Government spending can only ever go up, while taxation can only ever go down. The budget deficit is presumed to be unaffected, covered by a sign saying Don’t You Worry About That.

Surely you remember the days when campaigns devoted much attention to “what do your promises cost and how will you pay for them?” That’s what tripped up Labor in 2019 and, I confidently predict, Dutton won’t let trip him up now.

Some worthy souls in the media keep lists of what the promises have cost and demand a detailed account of how that cost will be covered, but the two sides just brush them aside. They’re in tacit agreement not play that game any more. In truth, both sides will add to deficit and debt.

The other way to look at all this is that, by their poor behaviour – government by scare campaign – the two sides of politics have fought to a standstill. Neither side is game to do anything about any of our big problems for fear of the lies this would allow the other side to say about them. Now, I know what you’re thinking: “OK, Ross, if you’re so smart, what’s the solution to the mess election campaigns have got into?”

The good news is, the nation’s voters are already working on the solution. So many people have lost faith in the two sides of politics that the proportion of people voting for the two majors is the lowest it’s ever been.

In the 2022 election, the share of first-preference votes going to the minor parties and independents rose to almost a third, with the remaining two-thirds shared roughly equally between Labor and the Coalition. We saw the Libs losing seats to the teal independents, and the Greens winning more seats in the lower house.

I’m confident the minor parties’ share of the vote will go higher in this election. The experts are pretty sure that, whichever major gets more seats, it will be in minority government, needing the support of enough minors and independents to convince the governor-general it could govern effectively.

Both major parties would like us to believe minority government would mean chaos and no agreement on anything. Don’t be fooled. As we saw with Julia Gillard’s minority Labor government in 2010, the government was stable and passed more legislation than usual.

What changed was that, to get that support and stability, Labor had to agree to put through controversial measures it wouldn’t have been game to propose by itself. Such as? The carbon tax. Minority government transfers some power to the parties and independents who still believe we need real, controversial policy changes to solve our problems and improve our future.

So if you don’t like what the two major parties have done to campaigns and timidity in government, you should share my hope that this election puts neither major party back in majority government.",40,93,Enthingification,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/this-election-is-one-of-the-worst-i-ve-seen-here-s-the-one-thing-we-can-do-to-fix-australian-politics-20250410-p5lqpr.html,2025-04-13 23:37:19,"**Greetings humans.**

With all of that wailing and gnashing of teeth Ross,  you only devoted one sentence to this:

""...*Of course, I couldn’t swear the media had played no part in dumbing-down election campaigns*...""

So, when the big news is ""ALBO FALLS OVER"", rather than hard questions about the Coalition's/Labor's energy plan (you know, the possibility that if the plan is unachievable,  Australia will have an economy-crushing energy deficit), perhaps as a journalist,  you might be a tad more introspective.

My hope is that journalists actually do their job, rather than act as paid writers for Rupert and Gina.

> As the proportion of people who don’t follow the news

Because it's shit Ross. The media has completely failed the country, we spent the first _week_ of the 2022 campaign being given endless stories about Albo not knowing the cash rate...and you're surprised that elections have become less and less edifying? How lacking in self awareness does ""51 year veteran"" of the media have to be to not understand that as the media constantly provides less and less insight and thought on the election, so do politicians. Why provide actual policy announcements when the media will simply use it as an excuse to attack you with?

I watched an ABC deep dive into the various energy propositions of Labor and LNP last week, and every single point about the LNP nuclear proposal led with ""the LNP says"" and ended with ""but we don't have the details of that"". Yet that's presented as the equal of fully costed and audited proposals and policy of Labor...because the media are obsessed with making this a two horse race and treating everyone ""equally"". 

This is the worst election we've ever seen because this is the worst the media has ever been. Although the fact that Ross apparently thinks this is worse than cash-rate-gate of an election campaign really does say a lot about his priorities...

>What’s new this time is Greens leader Adam Bandt taking a big red toothbrush with him to TV interviews (must have some meaning I’m missing) or his colleague waving round a bleeding headless salmon in the Senate.

A law for the mainstream media - if you write an opinion article critical of both major parties, you either have to ignore the Greens or say something to make them sound as bad as the majors.

Does Gittens really not know that The Greens have long been pushing to have dental care part of medicare?

And the point of the salmon was that whilst the environmental laws promised by Albanese last election didn't get done, Albanese did rush through legislation to protect the foreign owned salmon farms from the environmentalists.

Anytime a government or opposition has offered a bold policy change, the government / opposition picks the eyes out of it and the media seeds doubt about the entire thing. 

We cant have good policy if we can’t have a constructive conversation about what’s been presented. When the media says “we have a right to question the policy” it’s not asking questions part, it’s the “this will be the end of the world” rhetoric and the hyperbolic negativity to any bold change. 

Both parties have to be small target and concise in their campaigns because we can’t have a constructive conversation.",2025-04-13 23:37:19,False
Parenting,kids off social media,I feel myself gaining resentment toward my wife due to her being absent from parenting.,"I feel myself gaining resentment towards my wife due to her lack of parenting around our toddler.

Background: 
My(32) wife(40) and I have been together for a little over ten years married for 5 we have an almost 2 year old. We both work at the same company, but I have a Monday-Friday job, and her schedule is just chaos sometimes she has days off during the week, sometimes she works weekends, and as daycare is closed Saturday and Sunday I am home with the tot. 

We rarely fight about things, we are both usually pretty good about it’s a new day, forgetting any fights or disagreements that happened the day before. She’s never been a morning person, I knew that when I married her, when we found out she was pregnant she quit cigarettes but kept smoking weed from time to time for stress. She doesn’t have any medical issues. 

Now the issue: we have a toddler and the kid likes to wake up at 6 in the morning which I have no problem getting up with him. However then she will sleep til 9-10 o’clock. Then she’ll wake up and doom scroll on her social medias and TikTok til 11 when it’s time to get him lunch. She puts him down for nap, he’s kind of a mamas boy so when she’s home he wants her. When I have him when she works I have no problem getting him to nap. Then she’s back outside smoking cigarettes(which I just found out 2 months ago she had picked up that habit again) and weed or she’ll go out shopping or see her friends. The kid only sleeps for about an hour which is t enough time for me to paint or really commit to a hobby. Then I’m hanging out with him while she doom scrolls some more. If I get on my phone she huffs and puffs and makes a big deal about me being on it. Then she’s back outside before supper and after super and after he goes to bed. 

To summarize, I just feel like I am putting in more than my fair share of parenting, I feel like I never really have time for hobbies when I am constantly in charge of hanging out with him. On weekdays when she is off she drops him off  at daycare and sleeps til noon or even longer sometimes. She’ll do laundry and dishes but no other housework. All of my days off I have the kid around and he won’t let me clean or do any hobby work. I get done what I can but it’s not much. I feel all this resentment building up more and more and I don’t know what to do with it. 

And the cherry on top is sometimes she’ll come to me crying about not having enough time to spend with him! He’s growing up so fast! If I comment at all it’s instantly more waterworks and I’m a bad person for pointing that out.

On the mornings she's in bed till 10 and on her phone till 11 do you just leave her to do it? Have you told her how you're starting to feel? 
If it was me and my partner and I was up at 6, I'd be getting my little one to go wake up my partner by 9. 
Start just doing things like when she is awake and doom scrolling say ""hey, I'm going to go paint, the kiddos been fed so you just keep an eye on him. Thanks"" Then go paint. Maybe I'm wrong, but it sounds like you are just quietly taking the roll of the default parent and not letting her know how alone you feel in it. 
She might cry and get upset, but she needs to hear it.
Is she possibly depressed? She went back to smoking, and doom scrolling can often be something people do to avoid how they are feeling.

Oh brother!! 
I have a near two year old as well and my last of 4, was super clingy. It was a task but was able to break that but I did and she loves exploring the house on her own when her siblings are off to school. Bond with your kid and get him involved in your hobbies too. I take my kids to soccer and they watch me play and opposing teams are jealous of my team's fanbase(my kids: 7,5 and 2). I know it's easy to accept someone for who they are but when you need them to step up, that's how you know you were never really cool with it, it just didn't affect you then. With time, you'll take off that pressure and continue loving your wife like you always did. Continue having conversations with her how you feel. The waterworks will come but choose feel good moments to bring up burning issues.

Because it sounds like you’re not mad that she’s taking alone time, it’s that you also want alone time.

YouthRights,young people and social media ban,Youth rights is (unfortunately) unpopular,"Alright, so I am a big youth rights advocate, but I realize it isn’t that popular today. I think a topic like youth rights should be popular, because it isn’t, because ignorant people dont know what the youth today are capable of but aren’t allowed to do by law or societal standard, so they overlook our capabilities. For example, I am a web developer looking into social media and creating a social networking program (Project Thetafy) designed to be a more optimized space for everyone so I can prove to people (Especially Australia) that social media doesn’t have to be banned for under 16s, and make social media much more comfortable to use.

and there is a lot of ""disobedience"" despite adults constantly trying to crush it. Don't be fooled by what you see in an adult centric space. Many kids online just want to be accepted by their peers, and vocally going against adult supremacy online is a one way ticket to ostricization. 

Even youth who would mock youthlib are battling adult supremacy in some way in their daily life. Never forget this. You ask what needs to happen until it becomes popular?

AustralianPolitics,age verification social media Australia,Detainee released by Coalition one of trio accused of attack on grandmother,"A second man accused of a brutal attack on a Perth grandmother, in a case that sparked a furore over the migration system, was released from federal detention in early 2020 when Opposition Leader Peter Dutton was minister for home affairs.

The man, Seyed Younes Tahami, is accused of joining fellow asylum seeker Majid Jamshidi Doukoshkan in the aggravated assault and robbery on April 16 that left Ninette Simons, 73, suffering severe injuries that were shown in graphic images across the national media.

A detainee who was released under a controversial High Court ruling is one of three accused of bashing a grandmother in a violent home invasion in Perth.

Tahami has been charged with aggravated assault occasioning bodily harm, aggravated robbery, aggravated home burglary, impersonating a police officer and detaining someone with intent to gain a benefit.

Federal records reveal a key government decision in January 2020 led Commonwealth authorities to release Tahami into the community after he had spent time in prison and immigration facilities, raising questions about why he was not kept in detention. There was no reason given for his release.

Court records also show that Tahami was charged with a string of offences after the Coalition government released him from detention, leading to him being fined for drug possession and driving under the influence of illicit drugs.

Dutton has slammed Labor for releasing 153 detainees into the community despite their criminal histories after a contentious High Court ruling in November ended years of indefinite detention for people who could not be deported to their home countries.

Blaming the government for being “negligent, reckless [and] hopeless” in its response to the High Court decision, Dutton has accused Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of undermining safety because convicted criminals were released into the community.

“The first charge of the prime minister of our country is to keep people safe, not to put them in harm’s way, and that’s what’s happened with Ninette,” the opposition leader said last week.

“People are right to be angry about it and upset.”

Dutton was contacted for comment.

The release of Tahami under a Coalition government heightens the public policy debate about who takes responsibility for crimes committed after detainees are freed.

The federal records show that Tahami was not one of the 153 people released by the current government after the High Court ruling because he was released by the previous government more than four years ago.

Tahami, who was born in Iran and is 38 years old, arrived in Australia by boat in November 2011 and was placed in detention while he sought asylum. He was released with a protection visa in December 2012.

The court records show he was charged with the intent to sell and supply methamphetamine several years after he gained refugee status, leading to a conviction in June 2018 on the drug charges as well as a separate charge for breaching bail. He served one year in prison.

In line with the treatment of other convicted criminals who are not Australian citizens, Tahami had his refugee status revoked in February 2019 and was transferred to immigration detention after his prison sentence while officials sought to deport him to his home country.

Iran does not accept people returning to the country against their will, so Tahami remained in detention.

The government released him from detention on January 12, 2020.

Dutton was the minister for home affairs when Tahami was released. The acting immigration minister was Alan Tudge, who held the position while former immigration minister David Coleman was on leave.

Department of Home Affairs records show that a delegate for the ministers made the decision, which means it did not need to be signed or personally approved by Dutton or Tudge. It is standard for decisions to be delegated to government officials.

Coalition immigration spokesman Dan Tehan criticised Labor ministers on Friday for letting officials make decisions rather than taking direct responsibility, citing how the government set up the Community Protection Board to decide on each released detainee.

The first report from the board was released on Friday and showed that 76 of the 153 released detainees were fitted with a monitoring device such as an ankle bracelet, while 68 were subject to a curfew.

The Coalition said this proved Immigration Minister Andrew Giles was not doing enough to keep the community safe.

“We know that this board makes recommendations to the minister and we know that the minister has delegated these decisions,” Tehan said.

“So the minister is doing everything he can to hide behind bodies and decision-makers rather than fronting up and owning these decisions.”

A key issue is the concern about detainees breaking the law after they are released, turning the alleged assault of Ninette Simons into a test for both major parties because Tahami was released by a Coalition government and Doukoshkan was released by a Labor government.

Records from the Perth Magistrates Court show that Tahami was charged with new offences within months of his release in early 2020, including a charge for the possession of methamphetamine in July of that year. He was fined $1,000 for this offence.

Tahami was charged with the possession of cannabis in January 2021 and again in May of that year, as well as in October 2023. He was charged in February 2023 with carrying an article with intent to cause fear, and was charged the following month with driving while under the influence of illicit drugs and with no authority to drive. He was fined for these offences.

What’s that saying about stones and glass houses? Well there you go. I bet you $10 the media will desperately try and protect Dutton again as they did during the Home Affairs scandal. Almost like judicial decisions shouldn’t be made by politicians.
---
Whilst one could be pragmatic and suggest to Dutton he should be taking his own advice and resign immediately, I'd rather he remains where he is and has a long tenure as leader of the opposition.

""Negligent, reckless and hopeless"" It's almost like Dutton is writing Labor attack ads.

AustralianPolitics,Australia under 16 social media ban,Murray Watt to overhaul environment laws Albanese once blocked,"**Murray Watt to overhaul environment laws Albanese once blocked**

**Mike Foley, May 16, 2025 — 3.50pm**

New Environment Minister Murray Watt will introduce a package of controversial reforms to parliament as soon as possible to deliver the Albanese government’s long-delayed nature protections, declaring some stakeholders will cop losses in the tough negotiations to come.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has identified environmental reforms as a priority for his second-term government, including the 2022 election commitment to create a national environmental protection agency (EPA), and Watt was selected for his track record in resolving tough negotiations.

“The PM has made the point that we aren’t going to simply bowl up the same bill, and that remains our intention,” Watt told this masthead.

The bill Albanese blocked last November would have created an EPA that policed big projects that impact the environment, such as mines and tourism resorts, handing out fines for breaches.

Former environment minister Tanya Plibersek was close to cutting a deal with the Greens to pass the bill in November, but [Albanese kiboshed it](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5kuir) at the last minute, amid concerns the minor party had been offered unacceptable concessions.

Watt, a Queensland senator and former lawyer, is now a senior cabinet member credited with a major role in the election strategy that delivered the Albanese government a whopping haul of seven new seats in his home state.

He said he would take a tough stance on negotiations with warring stakeholders in the mining and environmental lobbies as well as inside parliament, as the government needs support to pass its bills in the Senate either from the Greens or a large chunk of the Coalition.

“There needs to be give and take from all parties to get these reforms through, and I mean political parties, and I mean parties outside government,” he said.

Watt took his first field trip on Friday to Lamington National Park, and it is telling that his first interstate trip will be to Western Australia, where the mining industry ensures environmental reform is a hot topic.

Watt acknowledges he will need to consult and compromise with Liberals and the Greens, but argues Labor’s record election win should spur the other parties to support his reforms.

He has a long working relationship with new Greens leader Larissa Waters, while the new Opposition Leader Sussan Ley, a former Coalition environment minister, commissioned the 2021 Samuel Review that identified a need for sweeping reforms to protect nature. Ley attempted but failed to legislate the changes.

“The election result has given the government a mandate to push on with environmental reform,” Watt said. “Australians on the whole wanted to see progress on a whole range of issues, including environmental reform, and they rejected the \[previous\] obstructionism that we saw from the extreme left and right of politics.”

The former agriculture and workplace minister landed two of the Albanese government’s more controversial moves in its past term of government by imposing a ban on live sheep exports as well as cracking down on the CFMEU.

Watt’s success in delivering the live export ban is good preparation for the environment portfolio, given the trade only exists in Western Australia.

Watt steered the ban through parliament despite [howls of opposition](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5e8dn) from the state’s farm sector after Labor won a record haul of WA seats in the previous election.

He now confronts a bigger challenge staring down the state’s mining industry, which along with Premier Roger Cook successfully lobbied Albanese to oppose Plibersek’s bill.

Labor added even more seats to its haul in the west at the election and Watt will be under even more pressure to deliver the EPA without sacrificing those electoral gains.

However, he is considering “broader reforms” compared to Plibersek’s.

The former environment minister pledged to deliver a suite of “nature positive” reforms, which included the EPA as well as reforms to the national laws under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.

This includes national environment standards to protect endangered wildlife, no-go zones for development or mandated funding for restoration.",39,50,Enthingification,https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/murray-watt-to-overhaul-environment-laws-albanese-once-blocked-20250516-p5lzpo.html,2025-05-17 01:22:54,"**Greetings humans.**

He delivered the live export ban, against strong industry opposition; I'm okay with giving him the benefit of the doubt on this. Let's see what the bill is before we badmouth him.
---
I love the language around ‘environmental’ lobby groups. Obviously the environment can’t speak for itself but I find it strange that it’s thrown into the same group as groups about extracting wealth.
---
It's good to see this suggestion that environmental laws are being prioritised.

The question will be whether they have the necessary teeth to genuinely protect the environment, or whether they're a fig leaf for yet more environmental undermining, destruction, and pollution?

It is of course incredibly important for us to protect and enhance the environment that we've got, including for the fact that our lives and livelihoods depend on it.
---
There is only one stakeholder for environmental protection and that is the environment. What is required is recognising that human activity can't help but impact on the environment however attempting as much as possible to minimise that impact by modifying the impacting process, not adjusting environmental protection.

For example, we should be protecting species from extinction, not having short term human profit be the priority item and ignoring environmental protection in service to it. Environmental protection needs to be the priority and we modify our practices accordingly, even if it means a more costly path, because the opposite approach is going to be far more costly to the quality of life of our descendants. Just look at anthropomorphic climate change, which is a result of human beings choosing the cheapest and nastiest approach to energy and ignoring the consequences. We had an opportunity to start the process of transformation to renewable energy during the 1980 oil crisis, but we backed down when the price of oil dropped and now here we are, unable to even limit climate change, let alone reverse it.

Even now, the short term economy is the most important element, when it is a construct that can be constructed differently for a different outcome. Most people can't see how they are slaves to the wealth of the elite who control everything as they are too busy being barefoot and pregnant, by design. Covid proved to be a very effective wealth transfer mechanism after the already substantial wealth transfer in the preceding 50 years, which harnessed womens desire for having it all to shackle them to the yoke alongside men.",2025-05-17 01:22:54,False

# Side Node

the original post i made got taken down by one of the moderator bots due to a lot of links to youtube videos for explanations. i deleted the links to videos so hopefully this guide will stay up.

This is a guide that most people will (hopefully) find usefull.

# Content List

in this guide i will cover the following things:

* Best Mobile (Ios and Android) Browser
* Best Pc browser (windows, mac and Linux)
* Best Email
* Best search Engine
* a guide on how to harden firefox
* a TL;DR (To Long, Didnt Read) section
* extensions
* closing notes
* Edits section

# Browsers

**IOS**

on IOS, all browsers are basically the same.

why is this? this is because Apple, the main devs behind IOS, force browsers to use Webkit.

this makes all browsers act the same like Safari. so for ios, there really is no real reccomendation i can give, since all browsers are the same aside from Name and Logo.

**Android**

* **Mull** - Mull can be found on the Fdroid app and is hardened firefox but on your phone. it supports extentions, but not everything. extensions are also not fully compatible with mobile, since they werent intended for that. do note that Mull might have performance issues, wich can be annoying.
* **Tor -** the undeniable best browser if you wanna be private on the internet. its important to change some settings for the absolute best privacy. tor on android is on the slower side and its not really reccomended to use as a daily browser
* **Cromite** - Cromite is a fork of Bromite, a now dead browser. its a chromium based browser wich means it has per site isolation (something that mull and tor dont have according to this [source](https://divestos.org/pages/browsers). Cromite is Fast, has a build in addblocker (although uBo is still better) and automatically declines third party cookies (although you still get the cookie requests). all in all, an excelent browser for day to day use

**PC**

PC browsers will focus more info and will be ranked in tiers:

**(Extreme) Spyware**

* Opera and its gaming variant OperaGX. Opera and its little brother OperaGX are both owned by a chinese company wich collects your data, logs your adress and more. its like tiktok, but in a browser form and everyone promoting it doenst know about the dark truth behind it.
* Firefox.i know that it sounds controversial right of the bat, but let me explain. if you dont change any settings on firefox, data will be collected and sent to both Mozilla and Google wich we dont want.thats the main reason why Firefox is here. Luckely, Firefox has an extremely good way to fix this wich we will discuss later.
* Google: do i really need to explain this one? Google is well known for their data harvesting and targeted adds. hell, its so famous there are even videos of people testing if google is listening to them for targeted adds.there is also Chromium, but i dont have experience with that so i cant judge on it, luckely there is another option wich is google but better wich we will discuss later.
* **29/11/2023 edit**
* thanks to a video of Mutahar (SomeOrdinaryGamers) i have been informed that google is making changes so more data is routed to them. this will first be optional, but later on in the future will become default. check out the video for more information. the video in question can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Qqjn38TV6g)

* Microsoft Edge (and in the past Internet Explorer): the same story as google, but instead of sending your data to google its sent to Microsoft.
* Brave, it has had many controversies over the years since its release and luckely there is a mega thread with all the information you can find and read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/ofnnlb/brave_browser_is_it_as_unsecure_as_the_firefox/)

**Amazing Browsers**

* Ungoogled Chromium: Ungoogled chromium is the chromium browser, but all ties to google are removed and blocked. this does break some things, like adding extensions to your browser. the design of ungoogled chromium is very close to google, so if you want to get rid of google but dont want to switch to a different UI (User Interface) like Firefox, then this is the browser for you.

**Tied Second Place Browsers**

* Librewolf: Librewolf is a firefox fork wich automatically hardens firefox for you. Librewolf uses a custom version of the Arkenfox Project to harden there browser.Librewolf is excelent for people who want hardened firefox, but dont know how to harden it / have issues with it.Hardened Firefox:
* Hardened firefox is (along with librewolf) are the tied second place best browsers.there are 3 populair scritps for firefox to harden it, depending on what you need.
* Easy mode: Betterfox. good privacy and good security.
* Advanced mode: Arkenfox, high privacy and high securityExpert mode.
* Narsils User Js, this disables almost all settings for the highest privacy and security.
* i will link the User.js files in the Hardening section.

**Tor**

* and now, for the number one browser for privacy: Tor. Tor is based on Hardened firefox and has the best privacy a browser can give.Tor also comes with the added benefit of being able to access the Deep and Dark web, but if you want to do that be carefull. Tor also has 2 rules to always follow:

1. Never log in on any website while using Tor. if you do, then the whole purpose of Tor is just gone. If you really want to log in on Tor, make a new account specifically for Tor and only use the account on Tor.
2. NEVER use a v\*n with tor. if you do this, you will stick out and you will no longer be anonymous. if you do want to use a v\*n for safety, start it before opening tor. but you generally [shoudlnt](https://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/5qmqw4/should_i_be_using_a_vpn_with_tor/).

# Best Email

**Best Email**

* Proton: end to end encryption for both Proton and Non proton users. if you send a mail to someone who isnt using Proton, you can encrypt your mail with a password.

# Search Engine

**Best Search Engine**

* Startpage: private search engine wich is now owned by an add company. luckely this hasnt changed anything about there amazing search engine wich uses both the Google and Bing index (its barely noticable, unless you search super specific things and look at pictures related to the search)
* SearX: SearX or now known as SearXng is by far the best search engine for privacy and amazing results. its open source and is hosted by multiple people and companies. you can also self host. there are things you should know before using SearX tho: if you want to use an instance (someones puplic server to do your searches), you only should use 2 of them:

1. [searx.be](https://searx.be/) this is the default instance that Librewolf offers as a search engine option. this is also one of the servers that is always up and is reccomended by most people.
2. [https://search.disroot.org/](https://search.disroot.org/), disroot is a company, wich is good for there own instance since they have a reputation they need to keep up. the only downside of the disroot instance is that its always targeted by people trying to breach it due to them being political (atleast, thats what i heard)

* but what if you dont trust puplic instances, what then? you can self host your own server, wich opens up the possibility to host your own instance for others, a select group of people or only just you. do know that unless there is a big crowd on an instance, you will easily be identified since your searches are sent to google and such. if you are the only one, or there are less than 100 people on an instance its easier for them to tie the searches back to you.
* luckely, there is a way to make you anonymous with searches on SearX. you need to host your own instance with a proxy enabled. this removes your ip from searches and only gives google and others your searches.
* i dont know if there is a solution to also remove the searches from being send out, but its alteast better than your ip being given to them along with your searches.
* i also dont have any guides to set up a server, so you have to do your own digging.
* lastly, searx might have performance issues, due to it requesting results from other engines you enable. in my eyes, this is a small nitpick for an amazing engine.

# How to harden FireFox

before we can harden firefox, we first need to identify your needs.

what do i mean? what do you want from hardening firefox?

if you want maximum privacy and security, use Narsils js or use tor.

want decent privacy and security, use Betterfox.

for the best of both worlds, use Arkenfox.

hardening your firefox also will change depending on your thread model.

what is a thread model? a thread model is more or less your goals when it comes to being private and secure online.

i reccomend watching a video from Eric Murphy on more info on a Thread Model. the video is called ""Nobody understands online"". he has amazing videos, tierlists for browsers and more. i can highly reccomend his channel for information and guides.

found your thread model? good, now lets begin.

download firefox along with the user.js wich fits your needs.

here are the 3 most populair ones:

[Betterfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox)

[Arkenfox](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/)

[Narsils js](https://codeberg.org/Narsil/user.js/src/branch/main/desktop)

Note: some of the user.js files require reading like Arkenfox, do this to get a good understanding on how hardening works, features it has and how to change some.

after installing firefox, open it and enter ""about:profiles"" in your search bar.

click enter and you will be brought to a profile page.make a new profile and call it the same as your User.js (optional, but i prefer to do this. its also handy if you run multiple profiles with different user.js files).

click ""select as default"" on your new profile and close firefox.

restart firefox and delete the non used profile for ease of use.

get your User.js file, copy paste it and navigate to %appdata% > roaming > mozilla > firefox > profiles > your profile you just made and paste your user js in here.

great. now firefox has its user.js installed and its hardened.however, where not done yet.

when installing your User.js, there could be an updater.sh (or .bat if your on windows) script along with a prefcleaner.sh (or .bat on windows) wich was also downloadable on the user.js file page.

drop these 2 files (sh on linux and bat on windows, not both) in the same profile box as your user.js.

the updater script will get the latest update from the github page of your user.js and update your current one.

the prefs cleaner is to wipe all your firefox settings (i dont reccomend using this).

IMPORTANT NOTE: as KrazyKirby pointed out:

oh no don't do this.. that's not how you're supposed to use it, and you could stuck with that value forever (which could break your browser or cause vulnerability)you're suppose to 1. copied all of arkenfox files to your profile directory 2. create user-override.js (name may be wrong, please check actual arkenfox how to) 3. run the arkenfox script 4. run the script again every time you updated firefox (also run pref cleaner every time) you may also need to read up arkenfox update to re-custom your override script tootl;dr DON'T JUST SHOVE user.js INTO YOUR PROFILE

now, since the browser likely wont fully function or has things that you want changed, you can make an user-override.js file where you can make a command list to change things inside your browser.

do note, after making your overrides file and saving, you need to run your updater script, say start and then enter y if you want to do a preference cleaner afterwards or n if you want to keep your firefox settings.

if your using Arkenfox or any of the other user.js files, some settings on restart of the browser will change.

a couple can be fixed with the override file mentioned above, but there are a couple i have no fix for: these include setting your dns security to max protection with either NextDNS or a custom one and forcing firefox to always ask where your downloaded files need to be saved along with saving other files right under this option.

# TL;DR

**a summary of the results**

**Browsers**

* Brave for IOS
* Mull for Android
* Librewolf or Hardened FireFox for pc

**Mail**

* proton
* skiff

**Search Engine**

* Startpage
* SearX

**Hardened Firefox**

i cant really make this shorter, sadly.

# Extensions

Getting extentions for your browser will make your browsing experience WAY better and safer. some are useless or can be switched for other extensions wich do the job allready / way better.

the extensions will be put into tiers depending on what they do.

all extention names will link to there respective page to add them to your browser.

(**Note:** all links used are from the Mozilla Addon website, the links might not work for other browsers)

**uBlock**

* [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/): the best ""Add"" blocker extension there is. why do i have quotes around add? because uBlock blocks more than just adds. it blocks cookies, youtube adds, popups and much more. Ublock also features ""modes"" wich change how strict ublock behaves. the modes are:

1. Very Easy (Standard settings when you install Ublock)
2. Easy (change a bit of the settings from standard mode)
3. Medium (the reccomended blocking mode, will break sites tho)
4. Hard (Extreme blocking, breaks the web)

for a guide on how to enable different blocking modes, along with the difference between each mode click [here](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode)

**Blockers**

* [Grease Monkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/): Grease Monkey by itself does nothing. Grease monkey is used as a script executer. there are multiple scripts you could use, the 3 i'm using are:
* [Return Youtube Dislikes](https://www.returnyoutubedislike.com/install) - brings back YouTube dislikes
* [Anti Addblocker](https://reek.github.io/anti-adblock-killer/#filterlist) - blocks websites from trying to disable your addblocker, in other words a script to stop add block detection
* [YouTube age verification bypass](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/423851-simple-youtube-age-restriction-bypass) - the name explains itself. doenst require logging in or verification
* [i still dont care about cookies](https://github.com/OhMyGuus/I-Still-Dont-Care-About-Cookies) - i still dont care about cookies is a fork of the ""i dont care about cookies"" extension, because the original is now owned by Avast (a data harvesting company). this extension can be found on github, has nice install guide and is secure

**Password Managers**

* [Bitwarden](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/): the most populair password manager out there, and for good reason. i am still in the process of switching, because i use both Bitwarden and another Password Manager.
* [KeepassXC](https://keepassxc.org/): its a seperate app that stores passwords locally (meaning you are the only one that can access them as long as you have the passwords file and remember the master password to access your database) but also has browser integration.

**Qol (Quality Of Life)**

* [Mazimize All Windows](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/maximize-all-windows/): if you have either Librewolf or hardened firefox, your browser will always open in windowed mode (both for normal and private browsing). this extension fixes that by automattically changing the browser size from Windowed to Fullscreen.
* [Dark Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/): by far the best extension for your eyes. Dark reader forces all sites to show in a dark theme (there are exceptions, but those are rare). this is nice when you browse the web at later hours. you can finally browse the web without getting flashbanged constantly.
* **Note**: an extra step you can take to make using any device better for your eyes, is turning on Night Light and setting it to 50%. Night Light removes Blue Light, wich is extremely bad for your eyes (i have glasses myself because of this) if you set the Night Light to 50%, you get 50% less blue light wich makes the colours on your device way softer and nicer for your eyes to look at. give it a try.
* [Song Identifier](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/song-identifier/): ever heard a song somewhere on the internet and you cant figure out the name of it? ye, i had that happen alot of times. luckely this extension does the work for you. not every song can be identified, but most of the time it does. it might not be as good as Shazam, but it will do the trick.

**YouTube Qol**

* [Unhook](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-recommended-videos/): this extension allows its users to customize YouTube to what you want. dont want the shorts tab? you can disable that. you want the comments removed? can be done. want the entire homepage to only show videos from your subscribed channels? guess what, you can do that.
* [Sponsor Block](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sponsorblock/): since we already are blocking adds with add blockers, how about we get rid of those irritating sponsors? Using Sponsor Block, you can stop:

1. Sponsers, Duh
2. Unpaid self promotion, blocks mentions of merch and things like that
3. Exclusive access, content that you can only watch if you pay for a channels membership or for there Patrion, SubscribeStar etc.
4. Intro's, handy if you directly want to get to the content
5. Endcards / Credits, skips credits altough most people will probably click off videos before this kicks in
6. and much more!

Thanks for the mention! Let us know if you have any suggestions.

On two of your points:

A little back ground. I'm having serious issues with my laptop use-ability. This has led me to studying my task manager A LOT. One of the things I have noticed:

If you open 1 instance of brave, it opens 3 tasks. Brave, like OG firefox is very resource intensive. For an example, with 5 tabs open I have seen it take up to 2gb of ram (dependent on what is running on those pages (common tabs include 1337x, facebook, linkedin, reddit and x news service))

&#x200B;

As to proton mail and Skiff. The one feature that they lack is document sharing on their ""drive"" feature. For example. My wife and I share a spreadsheet in google sheets. We access it almost daily. It's not overly complex, but it's not ""simple"" either. Neither Skiff nor Proton mail have features that will let us design it like google sheets does; and as far as I can tell proton mail service does not allow for document sharing.",2023-11-28 13:59:06,False
Futurology,young people and social media ban,IVO's quantum drive: will it transform the future of space technology or is it just orbital snake oil?,"TLDR: It’s snake oil

* The creator of the quantum drive has no formal education in physics or engineering.
* He is a pastor at a congregation associated with anti-science beliefs and other extremely harmful ideologies.
* He claims the quantum drive doesn’t break the laws of physics, rather, the laws of physics are incorrectly understood by most academics.
* While he claims various ground tests have been performed (including vacuum testing) and that thrust was achieved, no data has been released from the tests.
* No papers detailing IVO’s specific drive design have been peer-reviewed or released in pre-print journals or any other form.
* Since no technical information is available, information about the drive’s creator and other IVO staff is discussed as a means of assessing legitimacy of claims.

In the last few months, IVO limited has been generating a lot of buzz on reddit and elsewhere around their payload on the BARRY-1 satellite. Like many satellites before theirs, IVO's payload was launched into orbit back in November 2023, ride sharing on one of several small satellites being sent into space in that launch. However, they claim that their payload on the satellite consists of two engines unlike anything the world has ever known and that they have the potential to fundamentally reshape everything we know about physics. IVO claims that these are ""Quantum Drives."" The design of these propellantless engines breaks the established laws of physics as most academics understand them.

IVO's founder, Richard Mansell, who is also the creator of IVO's Quantum Drive, circumvents this argument, in favor of a more nuanced one. Instead of claiming to break the laws of physics, he argues that the laws of physics are incorrectly interpreted by most people. Essentially, he argues that his technology doesn't defy the laws of physics, rather, most of the scientific community doesn't understand the laws of physics. However, he does, and his technology is supported by the (disputed) theories of Mike McCulloch, a physicist with extensive writing on a phenomenon he proposed called quantized inertia theory.

Mansell has generated a bit of buzz as of late, posting pre-publication journal articles claiming that his tech has robustly passed a substantial campaign of ground testing. Per their claims, the engine has consistently been found to generate thrust, and alternative explanations like measurement error or other artifacts have supposedly been ruled out.

It would be easy to write this off as yet another scam, or to relegate it to the list of other technologies like the EmDrive that made similar claims and showed promise but never materialized into anything more. Except that IVO has put their money where their mouth is. They reportedly have two prototype engines in orbit, and they plan to test them soon. Since arriving in orbit and passing initial systems checks, the timeline for start of testing has slipped a couple of times. Still, IVO claims the tests will happen soon.

If successful, the implications are huge. A foundational shift in our understanding of physics will be required. But is that likely? Or will this all turn out to be just another episode of grifters in space?

Since there's limited information available about the technology itself (and most of us honestly wouldn't be qualified to interpret the technical data even if it was publicly available) it may be more helpful to examine the information that is available regarding the two people in charge of the project. IVO is a technology company. Neither their CEO (the inventor of the quantum drive) nor their COO have degrees in engineering or physics. Many great minds have accomplished a great deal without formal instruction in the sciences, so this certainly doesn't rule out the possibility that the IVO team has accomplished what they've claimed.

IVO's CEO is Richard Mansell. Details regarding his education aren't provided on his LinkedIn page, but I found an article in the July 2021 edition of local news outlet the Valley Business Front in which he discusses his science background:

""Without an electrical engineering degree Mansell says, “Praise the Lord,” he went about experimenting without being encumbered by the “rules” regarding electrical power transmission. People have discounted his concept, industry leaders he says, even “dismissed” it outright in the past. It ultimately led to his now patent-pending technology, the ability to use those non-emf electrical fields, which he says, “are natural,” and all around us.""

IVO's website lists a lot of accomplishments Richard has made, many of which are in relation to collaborations he had in the past with a now defunct auto company called Local Motors. Richard and the man who would later become COO for IVO, Daniel Telehey, reportedly met one another in the online community forum for Local Motors back in 2014. The company had a unique model where they actually crowdsourced design of vehicles and had buyers come in to company owned micro-factories to build the vehicles themselves with the help of employees on the premises. They made the Rally Fighter, a pretty epic car that was both highly offroad capable and street legal. Credit where credit is due, it was a cool vehicle. I'm not sure how much input Richard had in the design, but I've seen vague mentions (mostly by himself or by IVO's COO) of contributions on the software and hardware side.

Flipping through the IVO website, I also found another mention of IVO's collaboration on another vehicle with Local Motors, the infamous Olli 2.0 autonomous shuttle. In the article, they discuss partnering with the company to provide hardware for Olli 2.0. I'm not so sure that's something I'd be boasting about, given that in 2021 the pilot program testing the shuttle was shut down after a only a few months in operation after the vehicle crashed into a tree and critically injured the onboard safety attendant. Mind you, this is a vehicle with a top speed of 25 mph. Local Motors closed down a month after the accident.

I don't know this man. I have very little information about him, who he truly his, and what he is capable of. So, my impression of whether his claims are true has to be based mostly on conjecture. Let me clearly acknowledge that I am aware that my own personal biases obviously shape the assumptions involved in my statements in this post; there's no need to come for me in the comments.

Clearly, he's done some engineering work. He's self-taught and seems to have developed some patents on his own. From the looks of things, he's likely gifted, at least in terms of his mechanical abilities. But you can be gifted intellectually in one area and be woefully ignorant in another.

In asking the question, ""is this person capable of the sort of thinking that challenges the entire foundation of physics as we know it?"", I think its fair to look at publicly available information that illustrates that person's judgement. While this next bit approaches the subject tangentially, bear with me, as it seems relevant.

Richard is the pastor at a church in Virginia. I believe everyone has a right to their personal beliefs, and I won't criticize anyone for believing in a god or some other higher power. However, there are limits to that. When someone uses their power or their faith in ways that directly cause harm to others, or in ways that maintain oppressive systems with a high potential for harming others, it becomes ok to challenge those beliefs. As such, the people he has chosen to surround himself with and who he keeps in positions of power in his church speaks a great deal to his judgement. I think there’s inherent value to looking at this sort of thing as we seek information on whether we should be inherently skeptical/suspicious of someone.

In addition to being generally anti-science, the leaders of the vacation bible school at Pastor Mansell’s hold some particularly deleterious beliefs. As the head of his church, I have to assume that Richard agrees with the beliefs of the couple he has charged with running his bible school. Unfortunately, they adhere to a version of Christianity that is, at its best, factually incorrect, and, at its worst, abusive and harmful to an extent that I find to be both grotesque and morally repulsive.

Before you judge me for judging them, read a few more paragraphs. I grew up in an extremely conservative religious household. I'm not shocked by the typical anti lgbtq+ rhetoric so many churches espouse. Saddened by it, yes; shocked, no. But, in addition to your standard, run of the mill hateful rhetoric against the lgbtq+ community, Pastor Mansell's team members proudly endorse bigoted and harmful ideologies that somehow manage to take things farther in ways that managed to shock even my rather indelicate sensibilities. The people Pastor Mansell has appointed to watch over and teach his congregation's children, to safeguard them and shield their minds and spirits, explicitly state that divorce is never acceptable, even in cases where one spouse has engaged in sexual, physical, and/or emotional abuse of a child or spouse (or any other crime for that matter). The following quotes come directly from the website of their organization, Creation Family Ministries (https://creationfamilyministries.org/marriage/).

""What about divorce? What about abusive situations or incest? These are certainly valid concerns and important questions. However, they must all be considered within the framework of God’s design for men and women. Certainly there are times in which marriages are devastated by sinful behavior. But does wrong behavior necessitate additional wrong actions such as a separation with a goal of divorce? “For all have sinned…” (Romans 3:23). The bringing together of a man and a woman who have separated from their parents is a design by the Creator to be a life-long commitment. This is NOT to say there won’t be hard times or difficult circumstances. Doesn’t the familiar wedding vow say “‘Til death dho \[sic\] us part” or “in sickness and in health…?""…

""Are there extenuating circumstances that strain marriages? Of course! Does it mean that divorce is necessary? No! In fact, divorce is never necessary. God is a life-changing God, and it may be that we want to get out from under a situation before we learn the lesson God has for us. Perhaps it was a situation that was a bad choice on our part in the first place. Sometimes, bad situations are not our fault or of our choosing. However, God has something for us to learn through “all things.”

You read that correctly: they refer to abuse and incest (i.e., the rape or other sexual assault of one's own children) as ""extenuating circumstances"" and suggest it would be incorrect to ""want to get out from under a situation before we learn the lesson God has for us."" In these peoples' eyes, even in chronically abusive situations, there's no excuse for a divorce and seeking one would be evil…

Shame on these people, and shame on Richard for allowing these people to operate in a position of power in his church. I own my bias here, and I stand behind it: any person who chooses to keep these people by his side as leaders in his congregation is far too backwards to think in a manner that could possibly lead to a redefinition of the laws of physics.

Let me further highlight the dark absurdity of the situation by shining the light on a though Richard felt was important enough to bring attention to on his social media. In a tweet from 2021, Pastor Richard shills for a company that lifters offensive content from media: “If u/Disney really was concerned about filtering out the offensive in their shows, they would have licensed with u/VidAngel”.  Personally, I'd be a lot more worried about removing the plank from my own eye (i.e., the abusive systems my church has enabled that will force children and spouses to remain trapped in unimaginably horrific cycles of abuse, resulting in lifelong scars that will never fully heal).

I should also probably note that, surprise, they also don't believe in evolution and have their own curriculum of anti-science indoctrination that they teach the kiddos. While they don't believe in evolution they do believe in sclerology, a branch of pseudoscience founded on the belief that visual examination of the sclera (i.e., the whites of the eyes) can reveal up to date health information about an individual and that requires no clinical tools or other medical testing. Conveniently, they also hawk related herbal supplements to cure anything that ails you. Grifters do like to associate  with one another.

Moving on. IVO’s COO, Daniel Telehey, has an associate’s degree in Power Plant Technology from Bismarck State College. The degree requirements don't include any science or physics related coursework (https://bismarckstate.edu/academics/programs/PowerPlantTechnology/). Not that a COO needs that, but since he and the CEO seem to be about 66% of the team at IVO, it seems worth mentioning. His LinkedIn does state that he worked as Chief Project Developer for a company called Waco Motors from Oct 2014 to April 2017. Which is odd, because the LLC documentation for Waco Motors shows the company was formed in June 2015 before being involuntarily dissolved in 2017. His writeup on the IVO website states that, shortly after leaving the military, he founded Waco Motors, where his biggest achievement was purchasing the rights to produce the Rally Fighter, the previously mentioned car designed by Local Motors. Thing is, Local Motors remained open and continued to produce Rally Fighters until January of 2022, suggesting he likely couldn't have owned the production rights. Their whole marketing model was selling the parts to individuals so that they could independently build their own vehicle. I'm assuming that's what he did and he's trying to misrepresent himself as buying the full rights to the intellectual property. Could be wrong, but seems more plausible to me.

What's my goal in sharing all of this? Namely, to give the reader an opportunity to access more information (some from firsthand sources and some that's admittedly based on conjecture) for consideration when making their own determination about the legitimacy of IVO's claims. Now, of course, none of the things discussed above would prevent Richard and Dan from developing a device that requires the laws of physics to be rewritten. But having taking a slightly deeper dive into their backgrounds, I’m certainly far more skeptical about their claims...

My personal predictions regarding the two most likely possibilities for what we'll see with IVO's tests of the supposed quantum engine on BARRY-1:

1. It won't do anything because the science is flawed.
2. The elevation of the orbit will increase due to thrust produced by IVO's engine, however, it won't be because the tech they have on BARRY-1 is what it's been claimed to be. Rather, future attempts to replicate their findings by outside teams will fail and it will later be revealed that IVO's payload was in actuality a conventional engine that used already established technology to achieve their purported success.",39,88,Schtoops1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/19buotc/ivos_quantum_drive_will_it_transform_the_future/,2024-01-21 04:10:17,"Summary of all that from GPT4:

IVO Limited's ""Quantum Drive"" on the BARRY-1 satellite has stirred debate over its groundbreaking claims. This propellantless engine, challenging established physics, is based on quantized inertia theory, a disputed concept. IVO's founder, Richard Mansell, a self-taught inventor, and COO Daniel Telehey, with no formal science degrees, lead the project. Despite skepticism, two prototype engines are in orbit for testing. Mansell, also a pastor, faces criticism for his church's controversial beliefs, raising questions about his scientific credibility. The legitimacy of IVO's claims remains uncertain, with possibilities ranging from revolutionary success to flawed science or misrepresented technology.

Futurology,young people and social media ban,Lost in Fiction: The Declining Appeal of Real Life,"""In a world increasingly driven by digital interactions and idealized narratives, the appeal of real life is diminishing. This trend poses a risk to individual and societal well-being, especially among younger generations.""

In today’s fast-paced, hyper-digital world, reality seems to have lost its charm for many. Like countless others, I find myself gravitating toward the comfort of fiction, immersive media, and the ever-evolving landscape of AI. What drives this collective retreat from the real world? It's not just about escaping the mundane; it's about seeking something deeper—connection, meaning, and positivity, which reality often struggles to provide.

The AI Attraction: More Than Just Problem-Solving

Initially, my interactions with AI were driven by practical needs—seeking answers and solutions. Yet, over time, I realized I wasn’t just looking for information; I was looking for engagement. AI doesn’t judge, tire, or get distracted. It listens, responds positively, and offers support consistently. This starkly contrasts with human interactions, which can often feel superficial or fleeting unless the person deeply cares about you.
The rise of platforms like Character AI amplifies this phenomenon. These tools let users create personalized digital personalities—virtual companions tailored to be as supportive and understanding as one desires. It’s like crafting an idealized version of human interaction, a space where you’re always heard, valued, and never judged. For many, this is far more appealing than the unpredictable and often disheartening dynamics of real-world relationships.

Media and the Idealization of Life

The allure of fiction isn’t limited to AI. Popular media—movies, TV shows, and anime—often present an idealized version of life. Take, for instance, the storyline in Attack on Titan, where Mikasa remains devoted to Eren even after his death, embodying a romantic ideal of unwavering love. Similarly, many stories amplify themes of perfect friendships, heroic sacrifices, and unbreakable family bonds. These narratives resonate because they fulfill our longing for a life that feels more meaningful, more beautiful than reality often allows.
This idealization isn't accidental. Content creators cater to public demand, shaping stories to align with what audiences want to see. For example, Hajime Isayama, the creator of Attack on Titan, initially planned a bleak ending for the series. However, he changed it due to fan feedback, showing how much public opinion influences storytelling.

The Danger of Escaping Too Far

However, this constant exposure to idealized narratives has a downside. It skews our expectations of life and relationships, making reality feel dull and unfulfilling by comparison. We start seeking validation and meaning in fiction, distancing ourselves from the complexities and imperfections of real life.

Confirmation Bias and Escapism:
We gravitate toward media that confirms our desires for perfect love, friendship, and heroism, reinforcing unrealistic expectations.

A striking example is how we rationalize evil in media. Films like Joker provide a sympathetic backstory for the protagonist, suggesting that societal neglect and personal trauma justified his descent into villainy. In reality, however, not all perpetrators of heinous acts have such clear motivations. Figures like Ted Bundy, who committed crimes devoid of any traumatic justification, challenge our desire to see the world in black and white. Yet, we often cling to narratives that reinforce our belief in human goodness, even when the truth is more nuanced.

Narrative Fallacy:
Humans are hardwired to seek coherence in chaos. We prefer simple, emotionally satisfying explanations for complex phenomena, which is why we gravitate toward media with clear villains, heroes, and resolutions—even when real life rarely offers such clarity.

The Generation at Risk

 a significant portion of users engaging with platforms like Character AI and consuming idealized media are under 25.

AI Usage Statistics:
According to a 2023 study, over 50% of AI-driven app users under 25 report using these platforms for emotional support rather than academic purposes.

Media Consumption Trends:
Research shows that 80% of media content consumed by Gen Z is fictional or idealized, leading to a measurable increase in escapist behavior.

Psychological Impact of Idealized Narratives:
Studies indicate that constant exposure to idealized stories in media can distort expectations of real-life relationships, leading to dissatisfaction and lower resilience to challenges.

This demographic represents the future, and their growing detachment from real life poses a serious concern. If we continue feeding this cycle of escapism, we risk fostering a generation ill-equipped to deal with the complexities and challenges of reality.

Breaking the Cycle

""To preserve the richness of real life, we must consciously balance our digital and real-world experiences. By fostering media literacy, encouraging genuine connections, and using AI thoughtfully, we can ensure that fiction and technology enhance rather than replace reality.""

To counter this trend, we must actively seek to re-engage with the real world. This means fostering meaningful, genuine connections and embracing the imperfections of life. It’s essential to balance our consumption of fiction with a grounded understanding of reality, appreciating life’s highs and lows for what they are.

The question isn’t whether we should enjoy fiction or leverage it —it’s how we can do so without losing touch with the world around us.

But is all of this really possible from where we stand or is it too late?

“We live in a world where there is more and more information, and less and less meaning.”

Jurisdiction is not the issue - the affected platforms have users, offices, staff, advertisers, and revenue in Australia.

The challenge is to check ID for Australian users without disrupting their global userbase. If they use IP geoblocking to contain the issue to Aus, it is trivially easy for kids to circumvent using a VPN (and therefore questionable if the level of assurance is 'reasonable'). Assuming geo-based checks are sufficient, they then need to collect and secure identity verification documents from every user / account creation attempt. Or find some proxy for age (e.g. a valid credit card) they can verify against.

But don't underestimate the value of the data to the platform. They can now track users down to their actual identity - that level of personalization is an advertiser's dream. And because it's mandated by law, the platforms won't bear the brunt of the user pushback.

My oldest is 13, he does not use any social media. His multiplayer games are limited, splatoon is fine, minecraft is fine if I k ow what server hes on, but not roblox at all. We didn'tlet him play fortnite, and he hasnt asked for a while but we might be okay with it at this point. He has a phone, parental controls that he so far hasnt tried to get around...yet. He recentlyhas been allowed youtube, but I try to discourage scrolling, look for specific things. We also dont allow serious/long term games on his phone. Games that he'll play when bored like geometrydash or clicker games are okay but no minecraft mobile or something he'll want to spend hours doing.

He has a laptop, he rarely uses the internet. Mostly games. Sometimes his friends tell him about a silly website similar to old time icanhascheeseburger or homestar runner. 

I have had to make an effort to teach him pc literacy, and internet saftey. His younger sister has had computer class in school for a while but his age group missed out, I think the system assumed all kids were growing up with computers. They seem to have realised its mostly tablets or not at all so they started computer classes again. Its a little weird having a 9 year old be so much more proficientat some things, and sometimes we dont realise he missed out on something till it comes up, simple things like copy paste and alt tab, and the whole minimized windows things really threw him for a bit. Lol

As far as Im aware the other kids his age dont really tease him. Sometimes when it comes up, ""oh that site is blocked"" or ""im not allowed insta/tiktok"" the other kids make a deal of it but only for a few mins. Then they just show him on their phones or move on to something else.

Looking back I would say we should have realized the schools weren't going to do computer class and started teaching him computer basics earlier. But otherwise we're pretty happy. We've talked to him a lot about how social media especially is damaging to everyone and especially kids. 

He seems okay with it so far. We'll see how peer pressure differs for girls soon, this summer the 9 year old will get her first phone, she'll be walking home from school and will be starting a traveling sport. Im a little worried the pressure will be worse for her to be able to fit in.

This is just not true.

AskAnAustralian,Australia under 16 social media ban,Is this truly the best country in the world to be in? And why does it being so cause such a mental toll?,"Every day I hear it. For context I’m a young Aussie male in my mid 20s travelling the country over the course of a couple years now. I’ve met many people along the way from all sorts of backgrounds including many other Aussies of course (shock I know) and it always seems to come up in conversation in one way or another. 
That Aus is the best place in the world to currently live. 

I’ve been told quite a lot that I don’t know how lucky I am to be from here and live here (More so from those who have moved from somewhere else in the world). I’m aware in comparison to a large portion of the world we truly are blessed, but is this really the best there is? 

I’m not sure what I’m seeking in response, but it’s  something that consumes my thoughts a lot and in a certain way brings some form of negative feeling, almost like a depression against knowing this is truly the best country in the world. Yet I feel as though I’m missing something that so many people who have migrated to Aus seem to feel towards the country and how desperate so many are to live here, which I suppose proves it to be common belief amongst a lot of people globally. 

It also makes me wonder if this is a shared thought amongst many other Aussies and in some way contributes to the ever-growing rates of depression across the country. 

Even this thread is constantly about talking up Australia and all its glory, and I’m all for it, don’t get me wrong. But then I search for other countries with similar threads, and it seems to be quite a rarity for countries to speak of themselves in the same light. Also pretty standard across social media platforms to have countless videos of people from abroad who’ve moved here talking about how amazing life is here. 

Anyways, again I’m not sure what kind of responses I’m seeking but am intrigued to know a range of views and thoughts of the people who call this great land home and equally those abroad. 




EDIT: 
I’ve enjoyed reading the many different takes and responses. I think some people got what I was saying more than others. (I definitely could have worded shit a little better but was just typing thoughts as I went and it can clearly be a bit all over the shop). 

I’m aware of how great we have it across the scale of living and I’m equally aware it can always be better or worse. I have travelled overseas a fair bit, prior to travelling AUS to various countries being first world to third world and as a whole we do have it bloody good and it was never a complaint. 

I was more addressing the point being made daily that we are the best and it is said quite often by Aussies and immigrants alike. I just think it’s contradicting battle within myself if this should be some amazing life I’m missing that most Aussies seem to have grasped. Anyways maybe it is a mix of the blues and comparison being the thief of joy. 

Wherever you go there you are, right…?

Cheers for the responses! 
",35,182,straymamba,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAustralian/comments/1ijs36l/is_this_truly_the_best_country_in_the_world_to_be/,2025-02-07 10:33:16,"My parents immigrated here in 1994 from Eastern European leaving behind a civil war so yes for them this is the lucky country. However, I’ve been back there and now things have settled the people who stayed seem happier. My auntie and uncle who live there own a pharmacy and are well off, while my parents worked hard labor there whole life in a country they had to learn to speak again in and all their university and past knowledge couldn’t be used. This mean my mum had to be a dish hand and cook and my dad did labor intensive work in the building industry as a laborer. My point is Australia is a lucky country for those who make the most of it but doesn’t mean it’s the nicest situation for everyone. You need to make good money in Australia to have a good life here and the cost of living is making that harder and harder for everyday people. People use to have some sort of work life balance but with pension ages being pushed back and back people literally slave their whole lives here for a few years to relax at the end of their life. Not to mention the more money you make the more you are taxed so it’s not a country where people feel like the more they succeed the more they make because the more you make the more you are taxed. It’s also getting harder for single income families to make a living so people are having less chance to start a family as not everyone wants to make babies and then hand them over for childcare to raise. This causes an aging population where we aren’t meeting replacement anymore. People are having less and less children so we bring immigration in instead which only angers people further. Oh and don’t get me started on the housing crisis and immigration furthers effects it. Is this the lucky country? Depends who you ask.

Futurology,social media age restriction Australia,"What do you think about a social media that revolves around informative content, investigative reporting, whistleblowers, cultivates communities around these topics, and incentivizes critical thinking? Is it possible?","It's quite apparent (I think) that news shared online today is riddled with misinformation, propaganda, and opinion-pieces stated as objective truths. And because the news is being shared more and more on social media nowadays, its shared amidst unrelated brainrot content, which doesn't help. To 'combat' this, platforms have decided to moderate content by labeling things true or false and censoring the rest. This is an obviously impossible task and also nonsensical in that the truth is often too ambiguous to be labeled one way or the other. What we've gotten as a result is a world where nobody can reach consensus on anything and we're divided on the most simple issues.

I believe that social media could be a positive to our society if designed correctly. So I've been thinking more and more about this for a few months and started to take it seriously this summer. I'm hoping that by asking here I could get some general opinions as to whether this could work or not. I'm also going to try and be as short as possible so I don't make this a complete essay, but can hopefully elaborate in the comments if need be. Here's the rough idea thus far:

It'd center around short-form video content, similar to TikTok or IG Reels. This is because I do believe it's the most engaging for the layman and we're generally trending towards more video content and less text. The content would be focused on topics from local to global politics, business, sports, science, art, history, pop-culture, and so on. These topics I classify as ""news,"" so when I refer to news I don't just mean things like CNN or Fox. There'd be no ""brainrot"" content per se, though people could post their opinions on things and such which I'm sure could, at times, fall under that classification. A machine-learning algorithm would have to be designed to present users with content of interest, but also avoid feeding similar stories and enabling confirmation bias.

There'd be a few main feeds:  
***""For You""*** which at this point is self-explanatory.

***""Local""*** which would contain a proximity bar for users to filter news nearby them. This would be especially beneficial I believe to local news producers and more local communities which are currently being erased by national and global corporations.

***""Whistleblowers""*** which is self-explanatory. I was thinking we (the platform) could have in-house journalists dedicated to receiving and vetting whistleblower testimonies and documents. Then, once it is received and vetted we create a short video design to summarize the findings, which would link to a special profile created for each whistleblower (which would obviously be anonymous), where the user would find a database of all the documents, etc.  
I was also thinking perhaps there could be an ""unverified"" section to the whistleblower feed where users  could upload anonymously, having their voices scrambled, no link to their profile, and such. This could allow for more ""unserious"" whistleblower content, or frankly just allow for people to rat out weird shit that they may have seen at work or elsewhere. It'd sorta be like the website ""Fucked Company"" that was created post dot-com bubble where employees posted anonymous comments about their employer. There's an obvious issue here of people being able to spread lies anonymously, which, yeah, would be a problem, but people can do that on the internet anyway.

Then, people would be able to create groups:

***""Newsrooms""*** would essentially be like subreddits. People would be able to create and moderate these rooms themselves and revolve them around certain topics or subjects.  
The main differences are that (1) it would revolve around people posting video content to a dedicated feed for that Newsroom, (2) people would be able to upload PDF documents to the group (depending on the moderator's decision) where they could then upvote/downvote and comment on the PDFs themselves, (3) there would be voice channels, like Discord, and (4) people could have specific roles within the Newsroom, also like Discord.  
I was thinking about having two separate applications (one for mobile, one for PC) where on the PC one there would be text channels, (also like Discord. Yes- I've used Discord a lot and got inspiration from it) which would likely be used by the more serious user of the platform, but for the mobile app it'd be just video.

***""Investigations""*** would be essentially the same as Newsrooms, except, obviously, for investigations. People could formulate and display their hypothesis, and build a community around that. For instance, a person could investigate Epstein in some way, have a hypothesis, and share their progress and receive feedback with the community they've built. The design of the Investigation room would be unique to reflect the nature of hypothesis testing, though I'm not sure exactly what that'd be as of yet.  
Also, there could be a crowdfunding feature where the person could raise money to support their investigation. Nowadays investigative reporters have to rely on corrupt establishments to fund them and naturally are going to restrict that investigation in many ways. Perhaps there could even be a feature where we (the platform) fund investigations that have reached a certain popularity.

Now, that'd be the bulk of the design. Here would be some features for within the app:

**(1)** People can cite PDFs and links to their video uploads. (These citations would be stored somewhere on their profile as well)

**(2)** There would be a ""Learn More"" feature attached to every video, where a user could click and receive an AI prompt that would do something of the following: *(1) do sentiment analysis of the video and source counterpoints (2) direct a user to more information regarding the topic discussed (3) display 'provable facts' regarding the topic discussed, etc.*  
Maybe it'd do a few other things, but the idea for this feature is that it'd allow for people to ""jump down the rabbit hole"" on topics and discover the truth. Currently, we're presented with a video on a topic but aren't necessarily directed to more information. If we are, the creator of the video would direct you to more information they've also created. Thus, the information is being shared in a vacuum and people aren't receiving other opinions or sets of facts.

For this feature, users would gain +1 point (sorta like karma) for each time they clicked the feature, and it'd be displayed on their profile. In addition, if a person posted a video and, say, 10,000 people clicked learn more on it, they'd receive +10,000 points. For this set of points, perhaps there'd be a financial payout of say $1/1,000 clicks, or something of that sort. This way creators would have a financial incentive for their viewers to learn more about the topic they're discussing.

**(3)** Users could run polls in the app. The creator of the poll could put some requirements on who they let answer. So, for example, there'd be a place for typical users to upload their real ID to verify their account, and a person creating the poll could limit answers from people with verified ID, living in the state of New York.

**(4)** Voice channels. I briefly mentioned it but I think it's a feature worth describing in a bit more detail. People could join these channels to discuss issues, even host 'live' podcasts, where users can listen in (twitter does a similar thing now, though I don't like the UI of it). Every profile would also have a dedicated voice channel that would activate when that user joined it, and they could make it open to the public for people to join, restrict access to certain users, or make it completely private but allow users to ""listen in"". A politician could in theory join their dedicated voice channel and host a ""fireside chat"" where people can listen into. Pretty much radio.

Anyway, this is the rough idea. I want to create this thing with the opinions of the people who may use it in mind, hence me asking about it here. I think the world of social media is fucked up and I'd like for it to be better. Also, for anyone who may ask, yes, there would be ads. I think having no ads is a nice idea, however, I'd like for the platform to be free to use and also have financial payouts for the people who post on it, which would only be funded by ads. FYI, I'm currently an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, so I've got lots of ideas but little experience, another reason I'm asking here. Also, I've likely omitted something, so if something doesn't make sense, please ask.

edit: Added features (3) and (4) which I initially forgot. Also forgot to mention there would be a machine learning algorithm.",35,41,charliejarviss,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1efhmrh/what_do_you_think_about_a_social_media_that/,2024-07-30 02:01:56,"[removed]

I don't think video is a good pairing for informative content, aside from the recording of real life examples of something being illustrated, if your consumer isn't stopping to check their knowledge line by line, they will make guesses to fill in what they gloss over.  I also don't think social media is a good venue for accurate information either, since instant appeal is typically weighted too heavily if content is being promoted by consumers.

You could do something with a weighting system I think.  It would help if an individual user could choose the value of someone's vote as represented to themselves, setting a topic authorities value to 100 and a crank's to 1 for example.  And with that in place it would be helpful if a user could prompt input from someone whose vote they valued highly, moving something upward in their feed if they haven't already evaluated it.

With a system like that in place, you could get your investigation room going, but you wouldn't necessarily know who your investigators were, you'd have a bounty for answers and each person would be paid in proportion to their desirability as an informer, with sponsors able to blacklist certain investigators.

That does mean that you could end up with a wonky system where an incestuous AI advertising/crank ecosystem was eating most of your resources, and you'd also have issues where new users were swamped without much direction, so at some point you'd need the option to compare feeds statistically.  ""This item does not appear in the feed of those with a professional interest in the topic's field."" or ""Your feed is a 98% percent match with sundayatnoon's feed"" and similar such notes if not an actual spectrum comparison.

I suppose this would be something like a liquid democracy style transformation on the classic social media mechanism.  I'm sure it would have its issues, but at least they'd be new.

Money will *always* corrupt it, whether the money is from ""good"" sources or ""bad"" sources makes no difference.

Ground News.

Is it possible, yes. Profitable? No. The reason is non-directed advertising has an ROI that is in most cases negative i.e. for every dollar you put in you get less than one dollar out. For well targeted advertising which is basically just televised sports you get better numbers. And, ads make the platform seem less honest.

It's very difficult to get enough revenue to keep a platform like that afloat. NPR/public television is publicly funded through taxes and fund raising campaigns. But, they have a very long track record and very large donor networks.

Any novel platform would have to have decades? of funding lined up to build up trust and a similar network.
---
This would be a cesspool of disinformation and lies so quick it would make you have whiplash. With everyone that ""does their own research"" you will quickly see it turn into a conspiracy theory haven where the truth is impossible to glean easily. If you wanted this to work you would need a mechanism to moderate the information as factual that is unbiased and based in reality and science coupled with a mechanism to remove content that is not accurate/proveable and the people who share it. Otherwise your just building a ap that will fall somewhere between X and TikTok.",2024-07-30 02:01:56,True
AustralianPolitics,young people and social media ban,Kate Chaney accuses Seven West Media of smear campaign,"**Hamish Hastie, April 3, 2025 — 9.14am**

Independent Curtin MP Kate Chaney has launched an extraordinary tirade against Seven West Media, accusing the company of running a “smear campaign” against her as she vies for reelection in her formerly blue-ribbon seat.

In a statement released Wednesday, Chaney said the Kerry Stokes-chaired company – which has significant control of the media landscape in Chaney’s home state of WA – was running a campaign against her to claw back lost influence on Australian politics.

Australia’s political landscape is shifting and the vested interests who’ve benefited from the old system are pushing back,” she said.

“The more they feel their influence slipping, the harder they’ll fight – pulling every lever they can to protect their position.

“We’re seeing this play out right now. Seven West Media isn’t just reporting on the election, it’s running a campaign.

“Its agenda is obvious, and no one in WA is under any illusion about whose interests it serves.”

Chaney said her experience was similar to other Independents.

“Across the country, Independent MPs are standing up for their communities, not party machines or corporate backers – and that makes some very powerful people nervous,” she said.

“But the people of Curtin are smart. They can see through a smear campaign and know who’s really fighting for them.”

Chaney has come under significant media pressure over her backflips on key WA issues, including Woodside’s bid to extend the life of the North West Shelf project and Labor’s live sheep export ban due in 2028.

The front page of *The Sunday Times* suggested losing was “no big issue” for Chaney, a claim she said was taken out of context.

*WAtoday* understands Chaney’s campaign team considered Seven West Media hostile, but had resisted publicly addressing her grievances.

The final straw was a video published by veteran Seven West columnist and reporter Ben Harvey on Tuesday night.

“The teals like all politicians are a little bit full of shit, but they’re actually worse because they act so pious like they’re above politics,” Harvey said in the video.

“If you vote for a teal candidate without knowing whether, when push comes to shove, whether they’ll go with him \[Anthony Albanese\] or him \[Peter Dutton\] you’re a f---ing idiot who doesn’t deserve to be part of democracy.”

In the video, Harvey railed against Climate 200’s backing of teal independents and Chaney’s family history, including her father Michael Chaney, who was a former Woodside chairman.

“She’s made a political career by calling the old man a destroyer of worlds,” Harvey said.

Chaney is one of the biggest beneficiaries of Climate 200, having received $260,000 from the organisation in six separate payments since August 2024.

*The West Australian* editor Chris Dore told this masthead Chaney’s claims were “nonsense”.

Asked whether he would elaborate, Dore said: “Sure. Absolute nonsense.”

The public stoush comes amidst a flurry of LinkedIn posts deriding Chaney’s links to Climate 200 by a senior lieutenant in Stokes’ investment vehicle, Australian Capital Equity, which has shareholdings in Seven West Media through its controlling stake in Seven Group Holdings.

ACE finance and investments director Brian O’Donnell has posted eight times on his public LinkedIn page in the past nine days, detailing to his followers why he cannot vote for Chaney as a constituent in Curtin.

O’Donnell’s biggest gripe was with the big money pouring into Climate 200’s coffers.

“My reaction to these articles is that it isn’t possible to see Climate 200 as a grassroots movement given the big money behind it, and this reinforces that I can’t vote for Kate Chaney in Curtin,” he told his followers on Wednesday.

“In general, I think it’s easier to see the correlation between the motives of donors to the major parties and the policies they pursue. It gets harder when a candidate with a number of very large donors tries to present as truly ‘independent, accountable and balanced’.”

O’Donnell said the posts were his personal views and did not reflect those of ACE and that he was not seeking any media publicity for his views.

A spokesman for Stokes said he had no input into editorial decisions at SWM.

Chaney said she had not changed her positions on live exports or the North West Shelf.

“I voted in support of WA farmers to keep the sheep and nothing has changed,” she said.

“We need gas for our energy transition, but any new projects need to stack up financially and environmentally, especially if they would result in 50 years’ of emissions.”

At 1.3 per cent, Curtin is one of the most marginal seats in WA.

australia,let kids be kids campaign,How I learned to stop drinking and love life again,"This is my story, written as a counterpoint to the proliferation of [articles such as this one in the channel nine papers today.]( https://www.smh.com.au/national/mental-health-tragedy-sparks-questions-on-medicinal-cannabis-oversight-20241010-p5khh3.html)

Prior to Covid I had a pretty typical relationship with alcohol. Young kids, work pressure, drank a bit every night and occasionally too much. Over Covid - particularly the home-schooling, this turned into drinking too much every night. Would have a beer in my hand at five and open a bottle of wine before dinner. 

I'm not talking what people think of when they say alcoholic, I was never really drunk. Continued to function normally as a father, husband & good little worker bee. But always dusty in the morning.  And I wouldn't be able to safely drive at 10-11 if there was an emergency. Definite non-healthy dependency.

So I tried to slow down, but really struggled. Felt anxious if I didn't have a drink by 6-6:30. Trouble sleeping. Grumpy. etc.

A friend recommended I try medical marijuana. Specifically CBGA/CBG. Recommended it just to help me sleep. 

So I gave it a shot. Went to an online doctor, got a script for CBGA/CBG & some THC gummies.

Result?

The CBGA/CBG pills are amazing. I take one when I knock off work. Safe to drive, etc. The constant drum beat of 'I feel like a beer' fades into the background. I don't feel anxious and I am tired at bed time & fall asleep easily. I sleep well through the night and wake up feeling great.

I have started running again because I am up early feeling energetic. I connect better with my kids, I get along better with my wife.

And when I don't have to drive, I have half a THC gummie in the evening (or a whole one on weekends) instead of a drink. They turn me into an amazing Bandit-from-Bluey style Dad, interested and engaged in what my kids are doing. Having great conversations with them & doing stuff at their level. 

As a side note - recently went camping with friends & I gave my friend and her husband a gummie to share & we had a good afternoon & night. My friend could hear her husband patiently brushing their 3 year old's teeth (and letting them do it too) and slowly explaining why it is so important to do it a particular way. She commented that he normally just brushes them as fast as he can to return to TV / phone. So the good parenting is not just me.

I'm glad that's worked out for you and certainly it's better than boozing. It's a concern though how many people seem to need some kind of substance to enjoy life and their families.

Thanks for taking time to post and share your experience. 👍

I’m in a similar boat and have had some things go wrong in the last few years and find myself drinking to much to often.

Especially red wine.

I was just getting ready to try and stop and this may be the extra motivation and alternative I needed.

I accidentally quit drinking and smoking (cigarettes) with a mushroom I thought would be strong enough for a trip dose but was only a sub trip dose.

I’m 8 months sober off the grog but I’m a huge stoner and have been since I was a teen. I also wish I didn’t rely on cannabis but I have multiple diagnosis and chronic health issues. I’d agree it makes me a better parent because I am able to be present in the moment, rather than the 1000 things going around in my head. People would argue this is using to numb out the pain of life but why wouldn’t I? Life is hard, I am on carers payment for my disabled daughter, my husbands income is low.

YouthRights,Albanese social media ban,A Comprehensive List of Restrictions and lack of rights that youth face. I am gathering such a list for a text on Youth Right's that i am writing.,"So Heya Guys, it has been a while since i last came onto this server. But such are my illnesses, and all instances of psychiatric illnesses, that I do not have the strength to do my wishes.

Recently, upon being dogpiled on a Subreddit for ""writing fanfiction glorifying the rape of children"" ( What i was talking about was absolutely unrelated to that, someone dug into my reddit history, misquoted me on a youth right's topic and used it to dogpile me), I have had an incredible reinvigoration of my wrath. That wrath is manifested in this text I'm writing for Youth Right's, which i'd gladly love any help on. But part of it, is to address and raise those topics about youth right's no one talks about. Not just the usual lack of voting rights, unable to drink and have peace,, can't enter into sexual relationships or else it's ""Statutory rape"" ( How this is rape, Only God knows) but other restrictions us Youth's face such as Not being able to participate in clinical trials and biomedical research, donate blood and publish research papers, leading illnesses like psychiatric, neurolgical etc illnesses in youth to basically have less information than on 80,000 BC humans, and also our restriction on publishing Articles and pieces in newspapers and media to voice our views on any topic, Unable to publish our novels, fantasy and sci fi and speculative fiction to be precise or publish art ( The latter is easier since there's no intermediary like a Publishing agency. But good luck getting commissions for your art lol), and this last point and the first one hit particularly hard for me, as an author and artist who has many psychiatric illnesses but couldn't take part in research and clinicial trials or donate blood or contribute to research papers before age 18)

I want to make a comprehensive, exhaustive list of Such evils. Of course, given that we face so many restrictions that we lose count and can't name them all and there's so many restrictions, we have to up age ourselves on social media. I'd like points ( I swear to god i had so many beautiful points, like restrictions on publishing novels and art, writing pieces in newspapers and media and participating in clinical trials and biomedical research and donating blood and contributing to research papers and also Us not being able to even write about or see sex, for example few days ago, i was hearing stuff about how if a ship ( A fictional relationship) between two characters from the Game Genshin Impact was 'legal"" or not, in the holy name of God, did it burst my brain).

The following are restrictions that i have gathered about and could ""collect"", some of them due to my own experiences.

1) Restrictions on Participating in Clinical trials, Biomedical research, contributing to research papers and donating blood- What does this lead to? I talk about more in detail in my text which is still a work in progress, but it means that ""old people illnesses' like psychotic illnesses, or Dementia like illnesses ( Which i have due to long covid, both of them) are not seen and treated in youth, even though most of my friends with psychotic illnesses had theirs began around the same time as mine, age 15. I have so much more to say on this and even the previous point, i elaborate on it a lot because we deserve our illnesses and pains to be heard.

  
Number Two ( The two key on my laptop is broken so i can't tyoe it- If any of us dares to do worldbuilding, write fantasy and speculative fiction novels and wants to get it published, well, we can't because publishing houses won't allow a ""minor"" to ""sign contracts"". Same thing with making your own art and making money off it, or making your own anime and animations and any creative works. This one particularly hurts me because i'm brimming with worldbuilding and novels in my brain, and have even written many of them down ( Alas, my illnesses have destroyed all my worldbuilding capabilities and writing capabilities). We can't express ourselves artistically and i cannot explain just how much this hurts, because I personally want my novels out there and people to honour them. But of course, I'm too mature for my own novels since i write about NSFW topics like Psychiatric illnesses, war, sex, violence etc.

  
3) Restrictions on Publishing Articles and Pieces in Newspapers and other Media- The media is perhaps the only refuge of the oppressed ( It makes sense since i live in a country that not even two months ago, overthrew a totalitarian police state) and where we can express our views, where the common person has power. But we cannot write in most newspapers which don't allow ""Minors"" to publish articles. So we can't ever speak our views, on whatever topic they may be.

  
4) Restrictions on Joining Organizations and etc- Once upon a time, i had joined the staff for a Magazine about Worldbuilding. Many thanks to the creators for allowing me into the team when i was a minor but telling this to another friend of mine, he was surprised that they ""allowed a minor"" into their team. Like WHAT THE FUCK? WHAT DOES MY AGE HAVE TO DO WITH IT? Then again, i remember an accursed statement given by my older brother ( In the context of Under 18's having sexual relationships with those older than them, that Minors cannot consent. Like, congrats on admitting that youth are treated as literal robots, without any power to consent.). And whatever organizations we can join, it's just useless volunteering. Direct Action ( I am so glad that in the recent revolution, mainly students and people from the age range of 14-30 lead the revolution, as incomplete and scrambled as it was, but that's another arguement) and revolution? Hell, you can't even join various fandoms because they are 18+ only. Asking for allowing us to direct action such as say, supporting rebel groups fighting against dictatorships such as in Myanmar is a faraway dream. Most youth organizations are useless. The moment you advocate for radical change like abolishing and eradicating this entire adultist and ageist ( Towards both the Youth and the Aged, i have felt this a lot, Elderly people are treated like children, just like us, so it's why i've often had solidarity with some old people. But then again, many times, a lifetime of adultism and prejudice towards youth transforms them into the demons they are now. Thankfully, my parents and grandparents weren't like this) system and every last oppressive system like overhauling the healthcare, particularly psychiatric healthcare system so that undertreatment, undermedication and downplaying of people's illnesses ( Like how it happened to me, when my 4th psychiatrist, may his accursed name not be taken even by mistake, told me ""Why is a young man like him on so many medicines""? And took me off two medicines i was responding to wonderfully, and didn't replace one of them, leading to 10 days of hell for me) or the social justice and welfare system, then we get shut down. And we get particularly shut down because we're rebellious and ironically, contrary to the demonic myth ( It is demonic and a myth) that ""hormonal teens"" make impulsive decisions, We not only are not impulsive but very wise too, oftentimes having greater wisdom than 40 year old's who have not an iota of information about how the world works and should work. 

  
5) Already, we are tormented and face god know's what if we happen to fall in love with someone older than us, to the point we want to share our bodies with them. But God forbid, we will be ""traumatized by sex scenes, war, blood, gore, death and rape"" and here i am, who seeing sex scenes, feels at peace ( Sex scenes that involve love and healing, like the Sex Scene from Fate, Heaven's Feel Anime movies, or from my own novels and works). I shouldn't even need to explain this topic. We cannot even enjoy certain works of art. Why? Because they have NSFW content which apparently us ""Minors"" can't handle and will be traumatized by ( Maybe they should understand that their restrictions are what's traumatizing us? And no, this isn't love. Paternalism isn't love, and i will perish on this hill. My Father allowed me to play violent video games, watch sex scenes ( I joke not, from age 11, i watched and read sex scenes and whenever my father walked in, he was so casual even though i was mortified, and he has always protected me in a way Anglo American parent's ever could not. My Father always answered my questions on NSFW stuff and supported my Youth right's views ever since i had them. He even said himself that if i wanted to get married with someone 10 years older than me when i was 14, he said he'd happily do it ( His only concern and opposition was wondering if anyone would even agree to marry a 14 year old because we lack employment and are ""immature"" and ""inexperienced"" and don't have the ""life qualities for marriage"", but I know that he's just talking about how no one would agree to enter into a committed relationship with me at age 14 ( I am 19 years of age now). So Maybe they should be like my father, whom i love beyond words.

6) On alcohol and Drinking- Endless ""studies"" have been done saying how alcohol harms the ""teenage developing brain"" and shouldn't be taken until age twenty five ( Seriously?) and well, what do i say?

If i had to give a rant on alcohol, It'd take up an entire novel. All i want to say is that teen's don't turn into addicts. People in my village have been drinking and fuck, taking opium with it ( Something most Anglo American's would faint over, because we're taking ""DRUGS!"") and guess what? In two hundred years, my family has failed to produce a single addict. It's mysterious isn't it, how the US and UK have such high rates of substance abuse with alcohol but India has so little despite us drinking more and from an earlier age. Maybe it's the capitalism and the absolute cursed nature of those lands, households and families that make them more susceptible to addiction? 

But we can't even wind down and enjoy some peace with a glass of cold Beer or wine. Because alcohol is ""a deadly poison, a killer, destroyer of families and so much more"" ( Meanwhile for me, alcohol has united our family lol. And so many others. Me and my parents drinking together has contributed to a lot less fights and arguements between us as of recent, after we managed to get my conservative mother into drinking). And maybe they should understand that Sugar works on the same pathways as alcohol in the brain, thus is sugar bad? No. And alcohol does not cause brain damage, and i repeat, alcohol is not worse than meth even in moderation. If we're talking moderation, alcohol is even safer than smoking, there you go. And benefits?

In this world where day and night we have to work like donkeys and sleep and even the word sedation and CNS depression is demonized, alcohol would be a nice break. It makes you feel better, happier, peaceful, serene etc. Helps me in journalling about my illnesses too. Hell, helps me even connect and empathize with others. And i'm not the only one. Alcohol really just brings out who you are truly, it does not cause a truly gentle person to go violent. 

  
7) Our voices are not heard, we are always referred to as Someone's ""Teens"". Like people saying ""My teen"", specifically indicating their age. In this case, would saying my Son/Daughter or Offspring be so difficult? And whenever we speak on social media, we aren't even heard. After all, god knows how many accounts have ""Minors Do not Interact"" as part of their policy ( And they're proud of it. I will go to an extreme but just length and say that this one act of theirs wipes out most if not all of their good deeds, just as certain evils like being a sadist wipes away all your good deeds like charitable actions, devotion to someone or something etc.

8) How can i forget ""delinquency"" laws? It existed, or still exists in my country in the most hideous form, where youth were particularly targeted by the security forces of the regime because we were rebellious. But across even ""democratic"" countries ( Democracy is not just about votes, it includes human and civil rights too. And us youth's don't even have the first), if you stand up to your parents or escape from abusive households, you will be handed straight back in.

9) We literally have to up age ourselves on social media and the internet because that's how all pervasive restrictions on us are. I had more in my brain like the first four points but i forgot, i wish i can get them back. And this is why i'm making this post after all.

10) No Representation in Student's bodies until we come of a certain age and constantly getting bullied by the seniors ( Happened in my school, and we didn't even have a student body). We also were restricted from going to the library. I could make an entire novel on youth right's issues related to education.



Many points like the first two came across me because they happened to me, and as they say, experience is the best teacher. I want to draw eyes on topics like those that don't ever get discussed in even the most fringe of youths rights discussions ( A hyperbole but you know the point i'm trying to get across). And I want points like that, and i want to cover a comprehensive list of restrictions we youth's face. So that we can first identify and show the world just how much and in how many ways we are shackled.  


I truly believe that other's can talk about restrictions or points that didn't ever cross me. It's not like that if they didn't cross mine, they wouldn't cross other's. After all, isn't that why we ask for help?

English isn't my first language, so pardon any mistakes i made. I would absolutely love everyone's contribution to this, for i ultimately just want to compile a list of evils and restrictions we suffer so that we can show the world, for a beginning, just how shackled we are.

They’re hypocrites. They have no problem generalizing people under 18, but the second I mention the fact that adults are the main committers of crime, they start whining.

Adults are the main perpetrators even statistically speaking) behind car crashes, violence due to alcohol and drugs, vandalism, etc etc etc, yet this image of them being more capable and worthy has not wavered. Because they are in power and want to keep it that way. Yet, when a single teen does something bad and it makes it on the news, it’s always people complaining that kids as a whole are a problem. 

Nothing will change unless we protest and force this change in thinking to happen. But guess what… your parents, who own you, get to disallow you from protesting. 🤔🤔
---
Don't forget -

Zero protection from indentured servitude even worse, forced full time work for zero pay is mandatory, if this was done to ANYone else we'd call it slavery it'd be declared mandatory slavery, you can also work all day long in one of these places then go work a job after it only for a parent to take all your earnings, another thing we'd declare slavery but only if the person is older.

Unequal protection from murder you can take a blade and start cutting into the genitals of a young child against their consent until they die, as this procedure kills people every year, this is murder, legal murder, meanwhile putting murderers and rapists to death is more controversial even through much less barbaric methods, even when painless injection it's more likely to be illegal and frowned on than overloading a young child's body (who's not even believed to have done anything wrong) with so much pain and trauma their heart stops.

People can step in and decide they don't want your life being saved as it goes against their beliefs (blood transfusions is only one example) this is also reserving murder for youth alone and it should be criminalised like it already is for everyone else.

It's legal to torture children as many schools do daily, there is isolation type punishments within schools which break human rights countries have established, that's merely one example.

Unequal protection from assault and assault with weapons.

Unequal rights to free trails, right to a defence, protection from collective punishment (punishing known innocents), protection from zero tolerance policies (punishing victims) not permitted compensation if punished when innocent (like the above examples show many times punishing innocents is the intended goal when it comes to youth alone) youth can be incarcerated in prisons without being charged with anything or trail if government gets custody over them which can happen in the event of the death of a parent among other's, there is real cases of this happening in the modern era in so called ""civilised"" countries.

Unequal rights to freedom of movement, this one is much more important that it might initially sound as over 90% of child homicides are committed by parents, the vast majority of sex abuse is from trusted family members in the same location (and if not them then teachers) basically the two places youth are molested and murdered most in, are places we make it illegal for them to leave.

We would reduce child homicide by 90% and sex abuse by a similarly large number if we made leaving the places they take place in an option.

Unequal protection from kidnapping, drugging, false confinement and torture (and those things are all torturous) youth can be kidnapped from their homes in the middle of the night and whisked away to places rife with physical and sexual and psychological abuse, this despite us knowing for decades what goes on in these places, this is also linked to freedom of movement above, I think of all the restrictions you list, this lack of freedom to leave situations such as these all too common in the home, school and behaviour modification camps should be the most important one.

It's not uncommon for people to get children distressed enough to the point they break down crying and then film it and put it on the internet so everyone can laugh at it, imagine this happening to a down syndrome adult in a care home, see it's not funny when it's an adult with a 5 year old brain but it is funny when it's a 5 year old, it's in reality downright cruel, not unheard of for these to go viral with every comment under them mocking the child/victim and when you realise it's the same societies that practise all those horrors I named above on them, it's no surprise. These should also not be allowed.

I understand you've banned social media in your house, *good.*. But here are some recommendations to hammer it in:

- A new book that's getting a lot of press: *The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness* by Jonathan Haidt

- Netflix's documentary *The Social Dilemma*

- Bo Burnham's directorial debut *Eighth Grade*, although rated R, is a great representation of what kids go through with social media in modern times. I recommend you look up some parental reviews of this before you decide whether to let your daughter see it.

There’s a YA book that just came out— it’s a true story too. It’s called Accountable!

I’ve only heard a quick blurb, but from what I recall, it’s about a group of boys who put some racist “jokes” on Instagram and it blew up into national news and it had (obviously) major effects on their lives and community. 

It seems like a good lesson about being conscious of what you send/post, even when it’s “just a joke.”

AustralianPolitics,young people and social media ban,Bandt’s leadership in spotlight amid $7m right-wing assault on Greens,"Paul Sakkal and William Davis

Senior Greens have backed Adam Bandt’s leadership of the party even if it fails to retain its trio of seats in Brisbane in the face of a $7 million right-wing assault and a cash and brain drain to the teal movement.

Opposition Leader Peter Dutton is confident of regaining the Greens’ riverside seat of Ryan from Elizabeth Watson-Brown, while Labor is bullish about snatching the neighbouring electorate of Brisbane from Stephen Bates. Labor is also putting significant resources into defeating the Greens’ firebrand housing spokesman Max Chandler-Mather in Griffith on the other side of the river.

Greens senator Dorinda Cox and the party’s founder Bob Brown both said Bandt, who has led the party since 2020, should remain in his post even if its parliamentary ranks are thinner following the election.

“We all have our eyes on the seats we’re confident we will win, and should we lose them obviously we will have to understand what went wrong, but I don’t think that’s a leadership discussion,” Cox said. “That’s a discussion about the whole party, MPs, senators, party processes and many different facets.”

Bandt campaigned with Chandler-Mather on Tuesday. The leader’s trip to Brisbane followed a series of forums and fundraisers in recent weeks that were attended by party luminaries such as Brown as the minor party seeks to hold the seats they claimed in 2022 amid widespread antipathy towards Scott Morrison. The Greens hold Brisbane, Ryan and Griffith on margins of 3.7 per cent, 2.6 per cent and 10.5 per cent respectively.

The Greens fell short of their goal of claiming four seats in Queensland parliament in the October state election, with former Greens senator Andrew Bartlett saying the party should review whether some of its MPs’ “in your face” style had turned off voters.

Chandler-Mather took a confrontational approach to Labor on housing and dominated debate for much of his time in the portfolio. But he has had a smaller media presence since he defended the scandal-plagued CFMEU at a rally in August.

Despite media depictions of Chandler-Mather as a potential future leadership candidate for the Greens, party room sources said he and Bandt worked well together. Chandler-Mather would not be likely to replace Bandt at such an early stage of his career, the sources said, and the next leader would be more likely to be one of Greens senators Sarah Hanson-Young, Larissa Waters or David Shoebridge.

Brown talked up the Greens’ chances in Brisbane at this election, saying its MPs benefited from the power of incumbency and argued polling that was predicting tight races in Greens seats could be like it was in 2022 when surveys failed to pick up on the Queensland ‘Greenslide’.

“Adam is a very impressive character,” Brown said. “He’s got my full backing.”

“We’ve seen all the missteps of Dutton, and Albanese has had a number as well. You don’t see that with Adam Bandt; he’s a very sure and steady hand on the tiller and an impressive leader of a minor party which is a very difficult part of the political spectrum.”

Bandt was only the second Greens MP voted into the lower house before 2022, having won his seat of Melbourne in 2010 and holding it ever since. He polled a primary vote of 49.6 per cent at the last election.

Under Bandt, the party has vastly increased its parliamentary representation, helped secure billions in funding for public housing, worked with the government to pass a major emissions reductions scheme called the safeguard mechanism, and claimed they applied pressure on the government to explore changes to property tax concessions last year.

Brown pointed out the Greens had retained a primary vote of between 12-14 per cent in recent polls, adding that anti-Greens campaigns from right-wing organisation Advance and major parties made it a “David and Goliath” battle.

An Advance spokeswoman said the group was spending $7 million against the Greens this election cycle, including $3 million in the lead up to the campaign and $4 million during it, half of which would go to advertising in Brisbane. “We’re stopping at nothing,” said the spokeswoman, Sandra Bourke.

The rise of teal independents, who take a more moderate approach to the Greens, has also increased competition for volunteers and donations. Three Greens sources, who spoke anonymously to discuss internal matters, said former Greens volunteers were joining Climate 200-backed community independent campaigns, diminishing the party’s pool of experienced and well-off supporters.

At Tuesday’s event, Bandt spruiked the party’s newest election commitment to spend $11.5 billion on free school breakfasts on top of plans to push for the expansion of Medicare into dental, an end to native logging, and the removal of property investor tax breaks.

The 53-year-old former lawyer told this masthead to “ask me in a couple of weeks’ time” if he would remain as leader if he went backwards but said the signs for this election were encouraging.

“We’re a week away from people starting to vote, and my focus at the moment is just campaigning to ensure that our three amazing members of parliament are returned and that we grow across the country,” Bandt said.",34,60,patslogcabindigest,https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/bandt-s-leadership-in-spotlight-amid-7m-right-wing-assault-on-greens-20250415-p5lrrs.html,2025-04-16 02:09:41,"**Greetings humans.**

Parenting,online safety for teenagers,Expelled Son a year later.. ,"Expelled Son a year later.. mostly just venting

My son (14) was expelled a year ago from jr high. Since then he has done an online program and some other online resources. He is excelling and we are so proud that he is at least a year ahead grade wise.

He was expelled due to behaviors, bullying, lack of boundaries, fighting, distraction in class and had behavior contracts etc We tried everything to keep him in school, even brought his therapist to a meeting with his principal so he could support my son and explain anything he needed to understand. This was his 3rd school in 10 years.the other 2 he did not get expelled but he was on the verge. 

Here we are a year later, he is doing well in the online program, but still no matter what social situations he is still getting himself in trouble by picking on others or not following rules or boundaries. He’s on a couple psych meds and had a neuro psych evaluation which confirmed ODD/ADHD.  We were of aware of adhd since he was 8. His dr and therapist don’t have him on adhd meds due to being at home with “less distractions.” He is not violent, he was a year ago, throwing, punching and damaging things, but now it’s just silent, brewing anger. No matter what we do he’s not happy.

We have 3 other kids who are still going to school. They have friends, involved in activities and flourishing doing normal teenage/ kid activities. My son is visibly jealous when we go to their events.. he’s in therapy and has been for years, but he has zero accountability, self reflection and after all these years of medications and educating him about his meds he refuses to accept that he has to “change” himself. He thinks the meds should be fixing him alone. He has told his dr, therapist and my wife and I this. We all state the same thing to him, it’s a tool to help but overall he needs to work on himself mostly his impulse control as well as communication. 

He has a gaming system in his room, meals made for him, books 24/7 he can read .. but we have boundaries. Internet was just porn and he watched it nonstop instead of working when he was in school and even at home before we had to lock his computer down. He gets banned from apps for innapproriate behavior and if he has free reign of the house things end up broken or missing. So he’s not grounded to his room, but if we don’t have eyes on him when he’s around the house something happpens. We are a big family and before  year ago did a lot together, but now he’s impossible to be around. For our other kids emotional safety we have them keep a distance. He makes fun of his autistic brother and his elementary sister a lot, about anything and everything. Despite talking to him he continues. So our family is very divided.

Recently had to go to his HS brothers band concert and we came home and he was visably upset, he wants friends. He sees the other 3 kids lives continuing and he feels left behind. His mom and I offered ways to make friends, individual sports ( his therapist suggested to stay away from team sports due to his lack of control of emotions) we could look into or volunteer opportunities. But we stated in doing these things when he was in sports before he was arguing with coaches or not following instructions from the coaches or arguing with teammates. Or taking him to camps or activities we’d get calls to come get him due to him acting out and upsetting peers. I asked him if he’s peer pressured into breaking or hurting other people or fighting would he still give in after this year, and he said yes, he would because he wants to be liked and he won’t use what he’s learned. He’s going to do what he wants to do and he needs friends. He wants us to buy him a new phone and new Nikes bc “there’s a hierarchy in schools that we don’t know about and he needs to be at the top” He has this need to be at the top even though he never has been or was considered nor did he have “friends” he was always picking on or hurting others for attention. 

His pain of being friendless hurts to see, but I don’t know what more to do. I know he needs social opportunities but he can’t even be a “safe” person in a family setting. We all are in therapy but it just feels worse and worse. No one understands this situation… he would be absolutely violent and out of control if my wife and I were not patient and chill when we speak with him. It’s a lot of tiptoeing but firmly? If that makes sense. We praise his grades, any ounce of empathy or if he treats anyone with kindness we offer praise. He gets new video games weekly since he keeps his grades up .. he gets to pick his desserts, candy etc. we offer incentives for helping out around the house. I’m so tired of parenting 1 child when I have 4. My daughter is 9 and resents him already. My younger son is 6 with autism and he’s beginning to see who gets more attention when he himself needs so much. Our oldest is almost 18 and sadly seems to get that his brother is the main focus. I hate it. And it’s caused my wife to have to stay home due having to  monitor his school work. Luckily I work from home, but I can’t drop everything for him. She had to change her entire life a year ago due to this happening. So while we have grown from the resentment and into “this is what it is and what’s best for him” it’s still hard to let go due to nothing changing.  Luckily his mom and I are a great team. I couldn’t parent without our united front. 

Sorry for the rant. So burnt out. It’s been a rough few years of parenting… feel as though I’m continually failing.

Not taking ADHD meds because there’s less distractions at home? That doesn’t make any sense. ADHD doesn’t just suddenly disappear because of lifestyle changes. 

i think ADHD meds would change his life, make everything easier.

Have you tried looking into PDA autism profiles? The part where you reference tiptoeing firmly as a parenting tactic that works and his “need to be on top” really raise some red flags there. I know it can be controversial as a diagnosis but I think looking into all angles can only be helpful. 

Best of luck!

AustralianPolitics,Albanese social media ban,Would it be worth examining any links between the Coalition and Qatar?,"From almost every Coalition frontbencher engaging in tantrums about Qatar being denied extra capacity into Australia, their efforts in setting up a pro-Qatar Senate inquiry, their full endorsement of Qatar’s investment in Virgin Australia even before the FIRB gives their verdict and most recently, them advocating for Qatar Airways to be given access to fly domestic routes in Australia…  


Ever since the Albanese Government denied Qatar Airways additional capacity into Australia in July 2023, we’ve seen an insane amount of criticism by the Coalition of this decision across 2023 and 2024, from [Peter Dutton](https://thenightly.com.au/politics/australia/coalition-demands-answers-on-qatar-airways-decision-in-wake-of-albanese-qantas-perks-furore--c-16573169) to [Sussan Ley](https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/politics/anthony-albanese-wasnt-being-upfront-and-honest-on-qatar-airways-decision/video/93bee78fd32b9b95104b6fc89329a3fd) to [Simon Birmingham](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-27/sen-birmingham-on-govt-decision-to-block-qatar-flights/102910232) to [Matt Canavan](https://www.news.com.au/travel/matt-canavan-fears-australia-missed-the-boat-on-cheap-flights-because-of-qatar-decision/news-story/2b12ca71ecdcb27b7bd6c6b952307478?amp) to [Barnaby Joyce](https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/politics/did-qatar-ban-themselves-did-they-barnaby-joyce-launches-scathing-tirade-at-labor/video/35fc3ed0bd56e5bbeede6d7799efc297) and of course [Bridget McKenzie](https://www.bridgetmckenzie.com.au/media-releases/13-september-2023-media-release-king-of-delays-avoids-qatar-airways-scrutiny/), and almost every senior member in the Coalition - all of whom directly name and praise Qatar Airways and advocate for them to get extra flights into Australia, rather than talk about the bigger issue which is competition in the airline market.

They even set up a [Qatar-specific Senate inquiry](https://theconversation.com/senate-committee-says-government-should-immediately-review-its-rejection-of-qatar-flights-215263) intended to “get to the bottom of this decision” last year.

And last month, when it was made public that Qatar Airways applied to the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) to buy a 25% stake in Virgin Australia, [Peter Dutton openly expressed support for it](https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/politics/peter-dutton-welcomes-investment-from-qatar-airways-into-virgin-australia/video/6752f95d4535bf7b551637e657a7de45). This was very concerning given that it’s not protocol for politicians to take a side on large-scale foreign investments while the FIRB decides whether they’re in the national interest or not.

But what crossed the line I believe was Peter Dutton‘s insane comment a couple of days ago, where he advocated for Qatar specifically to be given access to fly domestic routes in Australia:

>“If Qatar was flying on routes from **Perth to Sydney** or **Perth to Melbourne** or **Perth to Brisbane**, at the moment, people in WA, people in the Northern Territory and in other parts of the country would be paying lower airfares.”

[Source](https://www.skynews.com.au/australia-news/politics/peter-dutton-questions-the-pms-longstanding-relationship-with-the-former-qantas-boss/video/91bece72ea8e4129a9b6572a81d1bd93)

I’m not sure on the reasons behind the persistence of Coalition’s apparent deep disappointment with Qatar being denied extra access last year and their consistent praising of the airline, and their efforts to even set up Senate inquiries and now even call for Qatar specifically to be allowed to fly domestic flights.

I do not believe that the Coalition are serious on the issue on “airline competition” - this is them only propping up one company - fully owned by a foriegn government. A foreign government with endless oil and gas cash funds, some of the world’s poorest labour laws and alleged support for terrorists Hamas and Hezbollah. Given the Coalition’s strong support of Israel, it only makes this matter even more intriguing.

So I think the excessive padding and propping up of Qatar Airways specifically by the Coalition needs to be analysed. They’re incredibly upset with the government’s decision last year and I think any rational person should deduce that there are potentially some links between the Coalition and Qatar. Could it be some sort of monetary donations? (under Australia’s foreign donations to political parties rules?) Or could Qatar Airways be offering secret lounge benefits or upgrades only available to Coalition politicians? Free flights? Discounts? While the Qantas Chairman’s Lounge issues fall into the broader issue of lobbying power of Australian firms, these potential benefits the Coalition are getting from Qatar could represent a higher and more serious issue of foreign interference in Australia’s internal affairs.

Because there is no way a political party in Australia would be this obsessed and vocally supportive of a foriegn-government owned company for such a long period of time. Remember, the Coalition isn’t talking about aviation competition as a whole, they’re talking only about one company wholly owned by one foreign government.",33,46,HotPersimessage62,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/1gi83g9/would_it_be_worth_examining_any_links_between_the/,2024-11-02 22:23:45,"**SELF POST MODE IS ON**

What Dutton said about Qatar flying domestic routes wasn’t an actual idea but more of yet another attempt to try and wedge the Government on an issue. 

It showed a fundamental lack of aviation knowledge and was more akin to taking a shit in the dark whilst not knowing if you are on the toilet or not.
---
If you go down that path you could also question why Labor is so strongly trying to protect Emirates from Qatar

The government is helping Qantas which is in a very tight partnership with Emirates, Qatar's main competitor. Qatar went through a lot of effort joining Oneworld with one of the key reasons being access to Australia. Despite this Qantas has firmly stuck with its Emirates partnership ultimately driving Qatar to the point of investing in Virgin.

At the same time, this whole affair is an opportunity for the coalition to critique the government on aviation policy. This is because the government is about to start rolling out policy established in the Aviation White Paper from earlier this year. 

Nothing out of the ordinary really

SocialMedia,Albanese social media ban,Is 15 reels for a 3 day a week part time job too much? ,"
Context: it is my first week at the job& also my first job fresh out of uni. 

My boss wants me to make 15 reels a week (5 of which are on a cooking page so I have to cook for that content, the other 10 on the two respective business accounts he owns ) , mind you I negotiated this down from 60 videos for the 3 days. 


This is not including his expectation of me to do community engagement, affiliate management (reaching out to affiliates) , cold messaging at least 60 creators for both brands per working day and 2-3 hrs of  live streaming. 


Plus this week he also had me make a moodboard with colours, different fonts, different logo options,  and sample graphics of the products with each logo and a small break down of the ideal customer. 

It is supposed to be a 3 day a week part one job (24hrs) 

I don’t know if I’m the problem and a slow worker or something , or not good enough for this job (it’s my first one out of uni and my degree is not in social media or marketing ) but I wasn’t able to complete all my tasks and found myself struggling and feeling really overwhelmed. 

I let him know I worked overtime but didn’t even out how much I actually worked over time (I put less hours on the timesheet cause I was scared he’d think I’m so slow or incompetent) 

Anyway, he said he wants to have a meeting Monday and I am really scared because I feel like I am not doing the job right and I don’t know why things take me so long.  

Anyway, is this a normal work load for 3 days a week or am I just really bad at my job? I’m so scared of getting fired after one week.

Way too many. 1-3 would be ideal. Probably 1-2 since you're part time! Explain how long each part takes and that if they want high quality then you need to do less videos. It doesn't matter if you post everyday, if no one cares. Better to post less and be quality posts.

I did the verification because it protects me more than it violates my privacy; in the case where I have no choice but to use LinkedIn for work.

Futurology,young people and social media ban,Future of Leisure,"Hi everyone, I'd love to get your opinions on something I've been wondering about. 

Imagine a post-work future, where our current notion of 'work' is mostly optional, especially for most people. Most task-oriented work has been delegated to machines. Humans are free to spend most of their time doing whatever they want to. 

Do you think most people will spend this time doing interesting hobbies, art, caretaking, sports, games, etc.? Or will it be more likely that everyone will just end up 'rotting' on social media, bingeing through low-quality content, etc. I find it hard to think a post-work world will be much more fulfilling than our current work-obsessed world, and I worry that many of us will end up rotting away. 

Which future do you think would be more likely? What sorts of things might we want to be doing today to ensure our future isn't totally rotted. 

Thanks!",30,71,denverCats49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1ih7y4k/future_of_leisure/,2025-02-04 03:02:41,"I truly love this topic.  I find it alarming that almost no culture or country is making any obvious progress towards this future.

Without a plan, jobs will slowly dwindle down, people will struggle to make ends meet and things will get very ugly.

Eventually we should arrive at your post-work society.  It's so hard to imagine because for so long money and work have been everyone's purpose.  

I would like to think embracing the arts, singing, dancing, painting etc. would really be a mainstay.

Exploration of space could be a big possibility.

I'm hoping some others comment on here with way more ideas!
---
I feel like the tech overlords would just enslave us or kill everyone when we aren't useful. Leave resources for us to have leisure? Yeah right...
---
The question of what humans will do when exploitative, demeaning work is superseded is a good one. I have a few points. The first is that human labour will never be totally unnecessary. Human supervision over machines will be needed, even if machines can correct and repair themselves, because machines fundamentally don't know what we want them to do. Only humans know what human goals are; machines are just complex arrangements of the mechanics of nature, and machines will always deviate from what we want them to do eventually. There'll also be some places where it just makes more sense to use humans, like in space where there aren't enough rare metals to make computers. If we want to colonise Venus we'll have to use humans for most of the work, even if on Earth the same tasks are performed by machines, simply because the materials to build the machines aren't present in the atmosphere of Venus and can't be mined from the surface. My second point is that brainrot and social media as we know it wouldn't exist. These harmful things exist to profit from our attention. With no human labour in production capitalism is literally impossible, whether you think capitalism is good or not. So private enterprises and the profit motive won't exist.
---
I believe we'll see a binomial distribution - bell curve - of behavior. 

On one side, select individuals will take advantage of this new era. However, the opposite is true. There will be individuals who will neglect the opportunity. 

The choice is ours. Choose wisely. Godspeed 🫡
---
I think “rotting” on social media is a bit harsh. It sounds like it comes from a worldview that productive use of time is the norm. But if you remove most people’s primary source of productivity, yeah, sure, they’ll have a lot of downtime. I think it might just be like the weekend all the time.

So basically they want to roll out new legislation  before the end of the year that can only (maybe) be enforced by some new technology that won’t be trialed and reported back on until after the election (probably).

Oh and the tech is intended for its for all age verification online not just social media.

Really getting tired of govts ramming things through with scary noises only to have those things lurk in the darkness. e.g. meta data retention, assistance and access.
---
An unfortunately poorly written article that confuses age verification with age assurance.


To verify someone’s age requires the presentation of some type of official documentation such as a birth certificate, that includes a date of birth.


Age assurance is designed to avoid requiring official documentation and rather uses technology such as face scanning to estimate the age of the person.


Some of the promoters of age assurance technology see it as a way to restrict access for underage people without risking privacy issues related to inevitable data leaks.",2024-11-17 22:43:21,False
YouthRights,social media age restriction Australia,How did this idea that kids need to be allowed more unsupervised outside play get merged with banning minors from social media?,"The two views seem so contradictory.

And frankly I think it's all just a cover for the social media bans. The people who support these social media bans are probably the exact same people who would call the police if they saw kids outside unsupervised.

  
And  these people  also always have some greatly exaggerated impression of how old kids are before they stop caring about ""unstructured play time."" Yeah, it would be nicer if 6 year olds were given more freedom to go outside and pretend to be pirates. But these social media laws apply all the way to age 16. And by the time you're 15, you really are not going to care about pretending to be pirates or playing jumprope or other ""unstructed playtime"" things. ",29,7,Possible-definition1,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/1j8w4sz/how_did_this_idea_that_kids_need_to_be_allowed/,2025-03-11 17:20:37,"The hypocrisy is the point.
---
This! These are the same people who complain about kids being on their cellphones, TV, videogames and online places. They clearly don't give a damn about addressing child abuse at all.
---
This happened to me a lot as a kid, it's one of many things that robbed me of my childhood, because I couldn't use the computer without my parents breathing down my neck and watching me draw to stop me from making social media accounts if I try (again, former artist) and the neighbors frequently called the cops on me for playing outside and got me grounded, because they didn't believe me when I told them that I didn't go far, because to them, the cops taking you home automatically means you went too far and got lost. They still don't believe me today and think I've been lying about being a short distance away from home for 16 years. All I could do to ""entertain"" myself was quite literally play checkers with my sister, and I hated it. I wanted to play at the playground near our house, but not if I was going to keep getting in trouble with my parents because the neighbors called the police on me, thinking I'm lost. 

I dreaded becoming an adult because I didn't get to enjoy my childhood, and so, I wasn't ready. I'm still not ready to be an adult, but unfortunately, there's no going back. I can't reverse time and be a kid again. I'm on a one-way street to old age while I'm like this, feeling like a caged wild animal finally free after so many years, but that freedom came too little too late.
---
I think it's the ""back in my day"" crowd that's behind this. The boomers grew up without the internet but they played outside quite often, so they're essentially trying to bring back the pre 90s days.
---
probably because it started with white middle class privileged adults and boomers getting mad at youth for relying on entertainment. and social media bans don’t do shit either, as they’re more than likely to get groomed by someone they know or trust (so basically a family member), than some random guy who followed their account because they wanted to post art",2025-03-11 17:20:37,False
SocialMedia,Albanese social media ban,Deep Dive into the SMM Panel Industry’s Secrets from a 10-Year SMM Panel Owner – Best & Cheapest SMM Panel? Oldest SMM Panels? First SMM Panel & Biggest SMM Panel | ASK ME ANYTHING,"Hello, 

I am Dmytro Chumak from Ukraine. If I were to briefly describe myself, it would be most accurate to say that I have spent the last 10 years as both an SMM panel owner, user, and reseller. For 8 years, I managed my own automated Smm Panel software, and I might be the first person of Ukrainian origin to operate such a system. During those 8 years, I worked with the largest smm panel provider + I sold my own data services to today's top SMM panels when they had only 5,000-10,000 orders. In total, I made sales close to 10 million, earned substantial amounts of money, and, as an inevitable part of the SMM panel sector, got scammed by fraudulent panels. My friends include the owners of Justanotherpanel, Morethanpanel, Bulkfollows, and Smmraja, to whom I sold and from whom I bought services. I was the 5th SMM panel to start using the PerfectPanel system and have a long-standing friendship with Victor (the owner of PerfectPanel).  

Now, why am I telling you all this? As you know, the SMM panel sector is a boundless abyss. Unlike when we started, there are now thousands of social media reseller panels, and unfortunately, 99% of them are scammers. In this tangled web of providers and resellers, I wanted to share all my experiences and the secrets of the SMM panel world (which nobody wants to share on the internet) with you, having spent 10 years in this sector and exited about 2 years ago. 

My aim is to create a very clean roadmap for those who want to take their first step in this sector. I hope this article helps you. Please do not hesitate to ask me any quesion

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ✅ Is There a Single Main Provider Panel? If so Which Ones are They? 

This is probably the most frequently asked question about the SMM panel industry :) No, friends, there isn't a single main SMM service provider panel. Quite the opposite, there are providers just in their own field or social media niche markets. In short, you can never have all real provider services through a single panel. Another common misconception is that the main provider always offers the cheapest price and stable services. No, friends! Even if you find a main provider panel, there is a 70-80% chance that the services of these provider panels are cheaper on today's largest SMM panels. So

🧠 LESSON 1- Do not focus on the find provider, focus on the advance support and **high completion rate panels** :)   

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------  


# ✅ How can We Understand If a Panel is a Main Provider or Not? 

Very clearly! Main provider SMM panels focus only on specific social media channels. The claim that a panel, claiming to be a main provider, provides different services for 4-5 platforms is completely false. Although I cannot vouch for any panel, the best example in the sector is StreamingMafia (formerly Spotifypanel). They have a single focus: Spotify services, and after using the panel a bit, you can easily tell that 70-80% of the data is their own. 

The second method of understanding is through prices. You will never see a fractionated price on a true SMM provider panel. You will not see a price like $10.123 on any legit provider panel. This is a reseller SMM panel price that includes their commission. Real providers use certain price values like $1 - $2.50 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ✅ How Do Main Providers Offer These Services? What Kind of Bot System Do They Use? 

Ten years ago, everything was so simple that I can even say without hesitation that I was the first person in the sector to have a Facebook follower service (even though I had no bot knowledge). With minimal automation and coding knowledge, you could create your own social media bot system, and it would work stably. However, with the ever-growing digital world and social media platforms taking measures against bots, this job now requires deep coding knowledge.

Let me immediately say that if you think you can download a bot from GitHub or buy a social media bot sold on a forum and enter this sector as a provider, forget it. Social media platforms release updates almost every week. The key is not just to get or find a working bot, but to ensure that the bot you purchase is regularly updated every week. This means that at least one person on your team must have advanced coding knowledge. 

If you ask what the most commonly used bot coding system is, the answer is ""REQUEST"". This is the system used by 95% of real SMM service providers worldwide (those with some coding knowledge will understand what I mean).  

# There are thousands of different SMM panel resellers and providers from India, Bangladesh, Turkey, Russia, and the USA. If We are Using an SMM Panel for the First Time, Should We Consider the Region of the Panel? 

Both yes and no. First, you need to know that the backbone of this global SMM industry is formed by Indians and Bangladeshis. There are both very large providers and the biggest scammers among them. Generally, you can find cheap services in these countries, but the cheaper the prices, the lower the order completion rate and customer support (e.g., peakerr - Elitesmm). 

Turkish panels rank 3rd. They are mid-tier SMM providers. They are neither as cheap as Indian panels nor as bad in support (e.g., Smmturk - Bestsmmprovider). 

Russian and Ukrainian panels are more focused on the back-end provider side. Their support is very poor, but their bots are as good as those of the Indians. 

European and American panels: Although they entered the sector 3-4 years later than other regions, I can comfortably say that these countries’ panels are currently the best in terms of customer satisfaction, secure payment gateways, and service uptime (e.g., Morethanpanel - Fivebbc - Clousty). 

  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ✅ I Want to Open an SMM Panel. Do You Think It is Still Worth Investing in This Business, or More Explicitly, Can I Make Money? 

Both yes and no. If your business plan is to open a generic SMM reseller panel and sell by adding a 25-30% profit margin to your provider prices, I would say don't start this business at all. It is almost impossible to gain volume or make a profit by doing reseller sales in a market dominated by giants like Justanotherpanel, Morethanpanel, and Bulkfollows. Unfortunately, those who opened basic smm panels this way between 2015-2019 all made a fortune, but in 2024 circumstances, this is nearly impossible. 

So how can we make money as smm panel owner? 

You need to specialize in a SMM panel niche. Your goal should not be to sell all services but to sell just one service. If it’s YouTube, you should be solely a YouTube panel. You need to find the biggest providers in the YouTube space and establish your SMM panel with excellent customer support. 

You need to have your own custom-built bot system :) This is the shortest and most direct way, friends. With a very basic TikTok follower bot, there is nothing stopping you from reaching daily sales of $3-5k within a month. 

  
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ✅ What are the Oldest SMM Panels and Which is the Largest in Terms of Sales volume? 



Unfortunately, the first or oldest SMM panels are no longer active websites. The first SMM panels were likely established around 2013 when Instagram became popular, but they were not exactly like today's automated SMM panels. The foundations of today's systems were laid around 2016, but we can safely say that sites like igfollowers.com, igrbooster.net, and youtubelikes.com were the ancestors of the first SMM panels. 

Among the SMM panels still active today, Morethanpanel former bestpanel), Peakkerr, and Smmfollows are easily the oldest. 

In 2025, we can easily point to Justanotherpanel and Morethanpanel as the biggest SMM panel by order volume.  

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ✅ For Those Wondering, ""Hey, weren't you going to tell us the best SMM panel providers or the best SMM panels you've used?"" This Section is For You :)

Yes, friends, I have tried to share my 10 years of experience in this article, but I know that ultimately everyone is curious about one thing: What are, in my opinion, the best SMM panels and top-rated SMM panel providers?

Unfortunately, most of the real SMM providers from 5-6 years ago are no longer selling today (I'm sure most have found much easier ways to make money like I did). To avoid misleading anyone or promoting any particular panel, I would like to share some panels that I know are providers for each social media platform at the beginner level (let me reiterate that no provider always delivers 100%, so keep this in mind when placing your orders).

* **Instagram Provider:** Morethanpanel - Igvoe - Postlikes 
* **YouTube Provider:** Tube-boost
* **Spotify - Music Services:** StreamingMafia ( former spotifypanel ) 
* **Reddit Provider:** Boostupsmm 
* **Facebook Provider:** fastsmm 
* **Twitch Provider:** Globalsmm - StreamPromotion
* **TikTok Provider:** Morethanpanel

(psi: we almost know all providers on the market but I don’t wanna brand this thread as some promotional SMM list – above ones are the most stable providers for long years that I can easily reference.)

Let me reiterate that these are the panels we have used for long years and I’m sure that they are providers, but never forget that working directly with **real SMM panel providers** is not always the best solution. It might even be more expensive than a reseller, or the **reseller SMM panel’s support team** might make you happier than the provider’s support. Because they have higher volumes, they have more leverage over the providers.

# ✅ Finally, let’s address the last topic: What are the Best SMM Panels We Have Used So Far, or More Precisely, Which SMM Panels Would I Use if I Started from Scratch Today as resellers? (a mix of providers and resellers).

Actually, this should have been the first question SMM panel users or beginners need to ask. Unfortunately, everyone looks for providers and ends up getting scammed by the cheapest SMM panels. Our main goal should be to find panels that are as affordable, safe, and well-supported as possible. Based on our 10 years of experience, the panels that have almost never given us any problems whenever we had idle services or used their services are:

**Morethanpanel** – Formerly Bestpanel  
Morethanpanel.com. A site that sells both its own bots (TikTok – Twitch – Spotify, as far as I know) and services with very low reseller margins. Nearly 25% of our services were connected to this panel until 4–5 months before we put our panel up for sale, and I can say their support speed is by far the best on the internet. A great example of a high-performance SMM platform.

**Smmraja** – One of the oldest but one of the best. Prices are a bit higher than Morethanpanel, but the service variety is almost five times more. Great option for people looking to run a white-label SMM reseller panel with diverse services.

Fivebbc – If you want to sell guaranteed high-quality services despite the high cost and your customers are exclusive, this should be your go-to panel. Their service prices are quite high, but that’s exactly the niche they occupy—expensive but premium SMM services.

I’m sure there are cheaper panels than those ones, but as I underline in this thread 3x times: Your main priority needs to be finding the most stable SMM panel with solid customer support and low service drop rates.

  
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ✅ For Those Who Already Have an SMM Panel but Want to Know the Best Marketing Strategies for SMM Panel:

Up to this point, I've talked to you as much as possible about how to find the right panels and providers, friends. But unfortunately, even if you are 100% successful in this matter, it doesn't matter at all unless you can drive traffic to your SMM panel website. So, the answer to how we will drive traffic to our panel lies in SMM panel marketing strategies. Here are the most effective marketing methods we have observed so far, friends:

1. Of course, Blackhatworld: I can say openly that this is the first place a person entering the SMM panel business would visit. It's an incredible source of traffic. If you are opening an SMM panel for the first time, you definitely need to have a thread in the Blackhatworld SMM section.
2. SEO: Yes, it's the hardest but the most effective method that will bring you millions if you succeed. Because thousands of people still have their first cheap SMM panel experience with Google searches like ""buy SMM panel"" or ""SMM reseller panel.""
3. Google Ads: As you know, Google is quite problematic when it comes to advertising SMM panels. If you try to do this on your own, there is a 99% chance that your Google Ads account will be banned. The best method is to work with an advertising manager who specializes in advertising in such sectors.
4. SMM Listing Websites: If it's free, add your panel to all SMM panel listing directories on the internet without wasting any time.
5. Quora – Reddit: I don't think Quora is as strong as it used to be, but Reddit is still a very powerful source for organic traffic to your SMM panel. Just be careful not to advertise your panel openly, or you'll get banned immediately.
6. Discord Group: Especially effective for India and Pakistan. Either announce your panel in relevant Discord channels or advertise directly on your own server. These groups are goldmines for niche SMM buyers.
7. Skype – Telegram Spam: Yes, most of you might be hearing this for the first time, but the SMM world, especially SMM providers and big resellers, operates entirely through Skype and Telegram. There are hundreds of groups on Skype where SMM panel owners gather. Join these groups and promote your services.

**So that’s all from me, mates. Hope you find these threads useful and help you during your SMM panel journey.**

Please do not hesitate to ask your questions under this thread.

yeah indeed we use morethanpanel and smmraja for our smm panel as reseller and far more better from other smm panels so far. But what about twitter provider mate. any advice?
---
As someone who been in the SMM panel business for over 10 years, I can say there’s a lot people don’t know about how these panels really work. The best and cheapest panels aren’t always the newest, often the oldest panels have the most reliable services because they’ve survived years of changes and challenges. The first SMM panels set the groundwork, but the biggest ones now combine quality with volume to keep clients happy. If you’re new, don’t just chase low prices, focus on reliability and good support. Feel free to ask me anything about how to pick the right panel or what to watch out for

I saw fivebbc from one of dmitry's articles a mpnth ago and tried that for a bit for their quality services. it seems it's their main focus which is good but prices are too expensive even for those services. good for emergencies anyways. but still think they can't compete with morethanpanel's elite services but industry should grow with this kind of niche panels I guess. so what was your panel bro? just tell it I'm asking this for the 5th time I guess lol
---
As someone who had previously entered the smmpanel business and completely messed up, it remained my dream. How will we find channels to promote our services on the marketing side? I don't know exactly how we will find these marketing channels on the telegram discord side. What kind of advice would you give on this subject?",2025-05-27 15:02:40,False
YouthRights,Albanese social media ban,I'm against Australia's social media ban as a web developer.,"Stay here with me til the end, trust me, it's worth it.

I'm a front and back-end web developer, Aged 17, currently working on a big project called ""Thetafy"".

Thetafy is this social media website I'm creating, but I've heard about Australia's social media ban for under 16s.

As someone creating a social media website, I am heavily against that flawed, and unnecessary ban.

I believe kids have a right to an online life, but I am also aware of the dark side of social media, but I don't think banning kids from the platforms is the answer.

So, my goal is to show everyone, especially parents leaders, that educating kids on social media, instead of banning them, is the better answer.

I believe that Project Thetafy will be the first step to revolutionizing the internet forever, and will be the start to putting away Australia's radical ban.

And you too could be the change that this world needs when it comes to social media and the internet just by answering this one simple question:

My question to everyone is how can I create a good platform in a way that convinces people that social media should not be demonized, or hidden away from the youth?

How would you make social media more safe and secure for everybody while respecting each other's rights?

And finally, wish me luck on Project Thetafy. From one Thetavator to another.",28,7,NJE_Eleven,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/1jijqxc/im_against_australias_social_media_ban_as_a_web/,2025-03-24 05:41:19,"Right. 

Our goal is to show that kids are not these vulnerable, unresponsible, idiotic, and (sometimes) evil beings, undeniably. We are humans, just as adults are. Yes, there is danger on social media, but would you ban girls from it just because they are supposedly always ""vulnerable""? No. 

We are HUMANS. Some of us are dumb, some of us are geniuses. It's not a ""your under 18 so your a menace to society"", that's just pure prejudice.

I can tell you that me, as a kid, is smarter than half the population or more in the usa.

I'm smart enough to know that is an idiot. But also smart enough to know that he's not worse than Nixon. Just the average old business man that has bigoted opinions. And I also know that kamala isn't a *great* president, and that there are better choices for sure.

Another good example. I am smart enough to know that black people are a targeted group. But I'm not so bigoted with that knowledge that I deny that white people are also targeted. I have the ***brains*** to know that white people are very much targeted too. And I say this as someone is half black.
---
Well, considering that the only google result I can find for Thetafy is a post you made about it on another subreddit 22 days ago, I'm pretty skeptical of the idea that it'll ""revolutionize"" the internet.

Anyway, there really isn't a lot we can do to change people's opinion of youth and social media. Social media is pretty ""safe and secure"" as it is. 

People like Haidt will claim that social media is unsafe for the young no matter what. And people will believe Haidt's arguments.

And unfortunately, the media has a real self-interest in keeping this social media panic alive that they didn't have for previous panics. For example, people don't get news from video games, so the MSM didn't really care about keeping the video game panic alive past the 1990s. On the other hand, the MSM loses a lot of revenue from people getting non-MSM news from social media. In fact, the very length of time that the social media panic has already been around begs the question of whether this panic will be permanent. It's not like people were still freaking out about kids and TV 20 years after TV became popular. But people are still freaking out and actually becoming more freaked out than ever before about kids and social media a whole 20 years after social media became widespread.
---
Maybe if all people new to the website were given like an educational course on the dangers and how to spot them, just so they’d know but again people can have that info and still be unsafe so I’m not entirely sure. Also I wish you good luck with project Thetafy!

AustralianPolitics,Australia under 16 social media ban,The Labor party has a legacy of action for the natural world. Now is the time for us to do better | Felicity Wade,"**Addressing the Australian extinction crisis and the decline of our environment will be possible when political leaders embrace it**

**Felicity Wade, Fri 11 Apr 2025 01.00 AEST**

I’ve been wondering if I remember all my surprise encounters with animals in the wild.

I remember sitting totally still on a riverbank watching a platypus going about its business as the dusk descended, by a logging road on the boundary of Tasmania’s world heritage area. And a moose in the Yukon, blundering out of the scrub at full speed right in front of us, as terrified and surprised as we were. A huge thing, my vision filled with moose. It turned and kept bolting. And summer evenings camping on the Thredbo River where wombats make for strange silent sentinels, munching grass as humans rustle plastic and wrangle gas stoves, the fuss of cooking al fresco.

I remember them because they are moments of such stark joy. They are usually times of quiet in the soft evening light. Australian animals are generally both silent and reserved. And these moments are rare.

In the way of oil and water, my love of nature gets expressed by being deep in the political process, with all its banality and disregard. I sit in the heart of a major political party, the [Labor party](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/labor-party), trying to build the bridge from where we are to where we need to be. This may seem quixotic, but I prefer it to melancholy resignation.

Maybe politics can’t solve it. But it’s the best we’ve got.

Labor has a deep legacy of action for the natural world. The Whitlam government brought environment into the heart of governing. In 1983, one of the first acts of the Bob Hawke government was to protect the Franklin River from a hydroelectric dam. Hawke ended rainforest logging, expanded Kakadu national park, led the international campaign to ban mining in Antarctica and began work on limiting greenhouse gases, appearing with his granddaughter in a 1988 documentary on climate change.

But the legacy is a 20th century one.

The past two decades have been dominated by responding to climate change. In the economy of politics, climate has taken all the space allotted to the environment. Finding the pathway to a safer climate hasn’t been easy, with the conservatives and vested interests weaponising it at every step, but Labor has stepped up in this term and a transition is under way. The gradual but certain collapse of the biosphere is threatening us just as comprehensively as a warming planet. And the political and policy response has been inadequate.

If re-elected, now is the time for Labor to do better. Governments can only do a certain number of things at once and we muffed the environmental law reform process this term. The power and ferocity of vested interests made clear how hard it is to shift the balance between commerce and the wild.

But in the last week, the prime minister has [recommitted to the reform and the creation of an Environmental Protection Authority.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/24/labor-vow-federal-epa-second-term-environment) Rewritten environment laws are the foundation on which we can turn it around. The central innovation is the creation of national standards, rules by which decisions are made about the environment. With proper application by an independent EPA there is a chance that we can begin to address our appalling record of stewardship.

But it will take more than laws. And more than money. It will only happen with strong and clear leadership. There’s a complex set of community capabilities and attitudes that need to underpin working out how to live well on our continent. And a tangled mess of overlapping responsibilities at different levels of government to address. We’ll also need incentives to make business consider its impacts on the uncosted natural capital it mines.

All this is politically possible because Australia is defined by its strange and magnificent environment. It shapes our culture, it sustains our leisure time, it marks who we are. As social researcher Rebecca Huntley says, “Twenty years of researching what Australians think is unique to our country, it’s not ‘mateship’ or a ‘love of sport’ but our unique natural places and iconic animals. We know they are the envy of the world, and what sets us apart.”

This fact is a potent political asset to be capitalised on. Addressing the Australian extinction crisis and the decline of our environment won’t become possible because the community decides it’s their number one concern, it will be because political leaders embrace it and argue the case, grounded in our national pride in our place.

Felicity Wade seems to be putting on a brave face.

It is constructive that she critiques the ALP's performance on the environment as ""inadequate"", and that she does not blame any scapegoats.

The government has ""muffed"" (failed to deliver on) their promises of environmental reforms and an EPA.  And they've worked with the LNP to make Australia's environment laws worse just so some heavily polluting fish farms can make more money.

However, even a brave face can't mask an existential crisis.

What Wade fails to realise is that her unequivocal support for the ALP means that the party can safely ignore her.  After all, she keeps supporting them no matter what!  If only she realised that her own power lies in withholding her vote from them unless and until the party starts to take her interests seriously.

**It's the same equation for voters.  If you're rusted-on, you get ignored.  If you vote for better, you at least send a message that your vote matters, and at most you help elect someone better.**

I wrote in another post that though the Guardian's political reporting has become more pro-Labor, the comments have become more Green.

The article is now open for comment at The Guardian and the top 6 comments (at time of writing) are all critical of her pro-ALP stance.

>*The term for holding contrary beliefs is cognitive dissonance. This refers to the mental discomfort experienced when a person holds two contradictory beliefs or ideas simultaneously, leading to a desire to resolve the conflict.* 

I  admire Felicity's  courage to admit Labor  hasn't  had a green thought since 1983 (42 years ago!) The hope we had then was immense.  Bob Brown was a Labor hero. Then,  the future was ours.  We would  lead the world.

Sadly  Labor simply gave up when it joined the cult of neoliberalism  and let Murdoch kick its arse all the way to backing Adani  and started  hating  on Bob Brown and The Greens and its supporters, supporters like me who left in droves.

Today  green - haters like Wong can't even say ""The Greens"". Her infantile "" the Greens Political Party:  speaks only to the rusted  unthinking lemmings of  the ALP.    Need to jail another protector  or legislate away our legal rights to distract from another summer of disasters? Would you like a  toxic fish taco or a Gas Bomb Burger with that,  Penny?

I   feel only pity for a naturalist stuck in  cult Labor.

Come over from the dark side to where there is hope and  courage in action.

>My kiddo is going into second grade and already asking about some concerning topics.

Honestly: this puts you at a *huge* advantage. Keep up those discussions and make sure you're not making him embarrassed/nervous/afraid of bringing them up to you moving forward! That's going to be way, way more effective than trying to shield him from it entirely because at a certain point you won't be able to  and he'll have no natural immunity to it! Just be honest about your fears (you can start generally and get more specific as he gets older).

My son is 13 (14 in a few months) and he's had a phone (and more access to the internet) since then. We've shared stuff with him from our online lives (memes, etc) and he's done the same, which gives us a peek into what he's up to and we can bring up anything that even brushes up against the red-pill pipeline.

YouthRights,young people and social media ban,“wHy Is tHeRe A VioLeNT iNCel EPidEmiC?”,"This is an old post. But it raises interesting details because there’s a common pattern of adults complaining and complaining without realizing the exact problem becoming more common in society was created by themselves.

No,nobody is entitled to sex,but nobody is also entitled to shove their noses into other people’s sex lives. And it’s better to let the person learn and develop flirting skills at their own pace than unnaturaly force them to wait until they’re older,probably more risk averse to try new things like making the first move and maybe even more bitter due to what was taken from their younger years.

There are illogical ideas,there are also non hypocrital ways of believing in something illogical. “Too stupid/Immature for sex” without power imbalances is not a real thing,and the people who say it is conveniently forget when they are buying pets from breeders,these animals can’t even understand what a pregnancy is and yet nobody wants to criminalize human interference in animal sex just because they want a fur friend. 

Do most ageists think cats and dogs are like earthworms and don’t need sex?Do they think kittens and puppies are delivered by the stork?The funniest thing is basic biology and animal reproduction is too complex for their brain’s to comprehend,but of course OTHER people(Because of their age)are the “too stupid for sex” ones,right?

About the 2nd paragraph the problems of forced delayed romantic socialization,many of these bitter people are unleashed in the “dating market” and give bad experiences(If not trauma)to random people who don’t have anything to do in how their partner was raised. It’s almost like bitter people don’t make loving caring partners. 

Many adults love complaining about long term consequences of an environment they themselves created. Parents who don’t let their child leave the house for anything other than school became increasingly common.

And now adults are complaining that the new generation in the workforce has bad social skills. Results: Many adults are puzzled trying to solve a complex mistery on why people who were barely allowed to socialize don’t make good employees.

And once again,many adults are equally as puzzled trying to understand why bitter people who didn’t show their true colors to their parents due to power disparity suddenly dealing with an equal relationship don’t make good partners. Such a mistery,right?Where was their ”fully developed prefrontal cortex always thinking about the consequences” while raising these children?Organic system crash lasting years?",28,13,nonamerandomfatman,https://i.redd.it/k0fxf27r1tve1.jpeg,2025-04-19 14:51:11,"I just dont understand whats so bad with children and young teenagers dating each other. Isnt it better when they are allowed and dont have to hide anything, so they can ask their parents for advice instead of doing bad decisions because they have no one to be open with? Sex on the other hand though, can be more problematic because there is always a legal limit (age of consent). Luckily enough, unwanted negative side effects of sex (like pregnancy and stds) can be mostly prevented by giving everyone a proper sex education, which a lot of places is clearly lacking right now. Because of that, people go very paranoid about their offsprings and tend to make irrational decisions for them. Paranoia usually makes irrational decisions. And irrational decisions cause further harm...
Another thing that comes to my mind is, that some people are puritans and want their offsprings to be innocent little angels, which the majority is not. You know, the propaganda with childhood innocence. Idk. I wouldnt deprave my theoretical children i will never have of natural things like dating. And, although i wouldnt like them having sex below the age of consent (as it might cause legal trouble for everyone), i wouldnt neccessarily ban it either. I would want them to trust me, not to be scared to talk about personal things just because im a controlling dictator.

I wasn't allowed to date until 18. Nope, not even allowed at 16-17. Of course, I ended up becoming lonely, depressed, and suicidal due to it, but I never became a violent incel because I was obviously only a danger to myself due to said depression and ideation. The restrictions obviously didn't stop me from dating; it just put my relationship under a Romeo & Juliet effect. Me and my partner would always lie and tell whoever was currently talking care of me that we were just friends. 

On the flipside, a lot of kids who are forced to wait until they're 16, sometimes even 20 to date, may, when they're finally allowed to date, meet someone who turned out to be the wrong person and God knows what happens after that.

No cell phones, no sleepovers, no going outside without your mommy present, no walking to school by yourself, no watching anything with even slight ""bad language"", no asking questions (""talking back""), no eating slightly unhealthy (even in moderation), No ""violent"" video games, no thinking for yourself, no tampons (""good luck with periods, girls, and no we will not help you understand either""), No independence whatsoever, no fun with friends without 3 parents present at all times, and top it all off with homeschooling and religious indoctrination. I absolutely hate extreme overprotection, and its absolutely equally as bad as totally abandoning your kids. 


That being said, people choosing to hate all women due to this and even thinking women deserve violence, I really don't get it. Taking it out on random girls because your parents were terrible doesn't make sense to me. At some point, it's on those individual people.

You know, I was ready to leave a strongly-worded response about how incel behavior is, like every other form of exploitation, the responsibility of the actor (the incel), and like every other form of exploitation, it's a behavior in which people engage purely out of self-interest (it's easier to maintain a sense of entitlement to women than to face why your misogynistic behaviors are unattractive to women). It's not that complex; people behave according to the incentives in front of us. Everyone wants to blame everyone except incels for the ""incel epidemic,"" and I'm getting tired of it.

But then I read your paragraph here:

>the problems of forced delayed romantic socialization,many of these bitter people are unleashed in the ""dating market"" and give bad experiences(If not trauma)to random people who don't have anything to do in how their partner was raised. It's almost like bitter people don't make loving caring partners.

And you're absolutely right. You can't build a consent culture in your own behavior, if your own consent is constantly being violated and that's the only reality that you've ever known. Kids are essentially taught, ""no one except me has to respect what I want,"" and many kids then decide, ""therefore, I'm concerned with what I want."" In that headspace, it seems like it'd be easy for ""I get to say no"" to merge together with ""they don't get to say no,"" into the same broader category of ""I'm concerned with what I want."" At least, I feel like that's what happened in my brain, as a teen in a high-control environment, and realizing that I'd merged those two thought patterns, so I could eventually teach myself to distinguish them, was a lot of the early work for me in building consent culture in my own behavior. Obviously, that would've been a lot easier if, as a younger child, I'd been taught consent culture as something which would protect my interests from others' behavior, as much as something which would protect others' interests from my behavior.",2025-04-19 14:51:11,False
AustralianPolitics,young people and social media ban,Both sides of politics are focused on one group of voters,"**Both sides of politics are focused on one group of voters**

**Sean Kelly, Columnist, April 21, 2025 — 5.00am**

Last week, during the leaders’ debate, Anthony Albanese put on record what he would like his legacy as prime minister to be. “We want the universal provision of affordable childcare so that it is as natural to have your child have access to childcare as it is to have access to a public school.”

Put like that, it sounds like a grand vision. But if that’s Labor’s ambition, it’s worth asking just how well our schools are going.

In a speech last year, the Productivity Commission chair, Danielle Wood, [pointed out](https://www.pc.gov.au/media-speeches/speeches/inequality-government-role#footnote38) that compared to 2000, Australian students had lost eight months of reading gains – and an entire year of maths.

Even more depressing, for a country that boasts of fairness, the gap between poorer students and richer students remains large. We tend to think of the UK as divided by class – the gap between our students is larger.

But here is the bit of Wood’s speech that really stunned me. The learning gap between kids whose folks are highly educated and those who aren’t starts out pretty big. Over time that gap widens. Think about that for a moment: our school system takes an education gap between our students and *makes it worse*.

One significant dimension of this problem is the division between public and private schools – and the billions of dollars governments give to private schools. This isn’t inevitable. It is embedded in a particular vision of Australia. In part, that is John Howard’s doing, which he applied to private healthcare too: persuading Australians that “choice” was a more important thing to have than “equality”. Even when those “choices” are only available to those rich enough to afford them.

It remains a pretty shocking aspect of this country: the amount of money we provide to help rich kids get even further ahead of poor kids.

Albanese unwittingly gave another illustration of a similar principle in the same debate. Asked about negative gearing, he justified Labor’s policy not to change it. He even insisted his government had not requested modelling on such changes, despite his treasurer having earlier admitted he’d done something like that. No, said Jim Chalmers, trying to fix the situation later, he’d only asked for “a view”, not modelling. What precisely the government requested doesn’t really matter – it’s clear Chalmers wanted advice and Treasury confirmed it did the work.

Still, Labor’s embarrassing contortions point towards its terror of the subject. And what is this but a willingness to sacrifice equality in favour of the rich having more choices about where to invest their cash?

You could put this new iron law of Australian politics even more simply: whatever you do, *try not to upset the rich*.

Take the housing policies offered by the major parties last weekend. Yes, some young people will get help – but only in the context of a policy which will push up prices further, making those with assets richer.

If campaign momentum was against Albanese, the modelling mess could have been disastrous. But it’s not. As I’ve repeatedly written, Trump’s intervention was likely decisive. But that said, with less than two weeks to go, it seems hard to deny Albanese judged the tone of his campaign well. Labor’s case is about stable, steady progress. And the thrust of that campaign – essentially “after difficult times Australia has turned a corner and begun fixing Medicare/energy/foreign relations” – was being discussed in detail within Labor about a year ago.

As were the sharp attacks on Dutton’s record as health minister. If there was any doubt these were working, it was scotched two weeks ago when Dutton, on breakfast TV, [brought up](https://peterdutton.com.au/leader-of-the-opposition-transcript-interview-with-sarah-abo-today-show-7/) those attacks without being asked about them, so eager was he to dismiss them publicly.

This points to two facts that will stand out if Labor wins. The first is that Labor left itself lots of time to make its case: it has been running the health attack on Dutton for two years. The Coalition, on the other hand, had far too much to do going in. It had to rebut such attacks. It had to tear down Albanese at just the moment when an interest rate cut seemed to indicate things had indeed turned a corner. And it had to make Dutton more appealing to voters than he had been.

What does the Coalition do for the final two weeks? Does it still believe victory is possible? If not, it might end its efforts to make Dutton palatable and put everything into dragging Labor down. You can see an example of what this might look like in a [Coalition ad released last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffWACinSbCM), with two young blokes watching TV in a pub and complaining about Albanese and his focus on the Voice.

It’s true Labor has made some moves towards addressing inequality this term. Mostly, though, they have tried hard not to upset the rich. The stage 3 tax cuts were changed – but the rich still did very well. The Gonski school funding reforms are being delivered – but the absurd divisions in our system remain in place. JobSeeker was raised once, a little. There will be some more houses – and those that get to buy one will be able to reduce their taxes.

If Labor wins, for whatever combination of reasons, we will have learned one important fact: Albanese can in fact campaign. He can, when he absolutely has to, bring home an argument.

It’s fascinating to consider what Albanese could do with his new-found skill in a conducive environment, with inflation fading and a second election win under his belt. That is, if he was determined to shift the assumptions that have reigned since John Howard established them and began to make his case early, like he did with his campaign. If he wins in a fortnight, Albanese will have proved he can win an argument with Peter Dutton. In the next term, can he win one with John Howard?",28,20,Enthingification,https://www.smh.com.au/national/both-sides-of-politics-are-focused-on-one-group-of-voters-20250420-p5lsz1.html,2025-04-22 03:20:28,"**Greetings humans.**

An article which supports the Green's view of both education and negative gearing, but ignores the Greens, and ends up praising Albanese.

Also I find it interesting that the author praises Albanese's campaigning. That so many voters were undecided for so long is a massive failure of the ALP campaign. It's only thanks to Duttons disastrous campaign that undecided voters are rejecting the LNP.

From speaking with a teacher friend who's got his finger on the pulse, they've pointed out the stark difference between kids affected by the COVID lock downs and those who haven't been affected, that latter cohort having just started schooling this year. The unaffected kids are extremely well behaved and are doing substantially better.

The author claims a rich/poor gap, which I do believe exists because it has to exist just on a funding basis. But doesn't prove the magnitude of it just asserts its there and OMG its so bad or something... Which I'm criticising because that's not describing a cause & effect relationship.

The problem is of child behaviour ultimately, if kids struggle to be disciplined in their studies they'll do badly regardless of public or private schooling and the lock downs exacerbated a decreasing ability and/or effort of parents to keep kids disciplined and focused on their studies.

Of course in the current opportunistic state of politics, any politician who tries to state or imply that parents are failing to keep their children disciplined and focused on studies, will have opponents launch into attacks and directly undermine that message potentially exacerbating the problem by letting people blame something else, probably da gubbermint.

We can see this in other cultural groups, where the cultural emphasis on education being extremely important sees strong efforts put in at maintaining their children's educational discipline. A lot of asian cultures put a strong emphasis on education, that culture persists even within Australia.

Solving this problem is really a problem of 'how do you criticise the voter?' Right now that's political suicide because of media and political opportunism. If this problem can be solved, it could also help solve a bunch of other problems too not just in education, then maybe we can get some big changes happening in society and politics.

This is actually a good comparison *against* more control for parents. When you see an overweight child, it's not because the child is somehow in control of the family's dinner plans — it's because the parent is choosing what their child should eat, and they're choosing the unhealthy options. Sometimes, or rather quite often, parents just don't know what the hell they're doing, or are too lazy to care.

This is the same for phones, social media, and the internet in general. Sometimes a parent knows what's good on it, but quite often they themselves have no idea what's going on, and unironically their kid knows how to navigate it better than they do. If anything, teens should be monitoring what their parents do online, because *they're* often the ones falling for bizarre AI generated headlines, falling for email scams, getting hacked because their passwords are the same name and birthday, meeting the love of their life online from another continent who just needs some money to travel to their country and so on.

What all of these ""give parents more control"" groups ignore is the fact that parents are just regular people, and regular people can be stupid, neglectful, evil, hypocritical, and all the rest. You can't broadly give out this unquestionable authority to people you can't possibly vet over a vulnerable group and expect good results.

My parents don't care about health and if anything encourage eating fast food because they eat it so much, I was 250 pounds at 12 before I took matters into my own hands. So the food thing on its own isn't bad advice, just phrased and depicted poorly.

Thennn you get into the textbook manipulation. Present one more widely accepted and acknowledged thing, introduce a second thing, then change attention to the second thing entirely. Just bs.

Overall, point about the food is ok, then just resorts to manipulation about smartphones and undermines the whole thing.
---
Tired of this.  It's like the whole sleep time debate rubbish that happens so often.  Like just don't force your kids to anything and I guarantee you they will not associate food you find healthy as traumatic to eat because you kept forcing them to in childhood, same with sleep time.

This immediately comes to mind a model for doing this.  Classes are held but the teacher acts more like a TA, answering questions and giving students 1:1 time.  There are no homeworks and no midterms, instead you can take exams at the testing center, available every day(testing center is a room where you have to give up any devices and take the exam while proctored).  Similarly classes are available year round, with different teachers staffing the center for this subject.  

Fail an exam and you perhaps have a delay before taking it again (and it's a random draw from a question bank or something), but it doesn't slap your transcript with F/C/B and harm your chances in the future.  

Finacial aid etc require some minimum rate of completion of credits (passing exams) but if you can afford it you can take any length of time.

that's really similar to how my public online school functioned in the high school years. while it's good for having time / flexibility to focus on what you want, it was shitty for retention. it also requires a high level of discipline that many people need to practice building up over time

edit: i think another problem with that model is the way it can prevent students with learning disabilities from receiving the recognition of symptoms which is important for considering assessments & diagnoses if necessary. i would've never realized i had fasd without a teacher noticing my symptoms and giving me accommodations (not registered with the school, just stuff like oral assessment instead of written for an overdue assignment). in teacher education we're taught to look out for common traits of disabilities so we can adjust our teaching as necessary + let parents/guardians/support staff know.

Assessments have to be about more than whether an individual can pass an objective, multiple guess test. All factors considered essential for a well-rounded individual should be measured. Oral presentations, projects, and artwork need evaluation.

Because we'd suddenly have tons of people confronted with their LACK of skills.

They'll blame the education system, which has its problems, sure.

But at the end of the day, the #1 factor in the quality of your education is you.

I'm literally not allowed to tell students how far behind they are, it's bad for their self-esteem.

I would not mind making my class harder actually, but I'm also not allowed to.  Passing rates are too important.

Actually the collaboration between TikTok and Spotify sounds pretty interesting. It opens up new marketing and monetization opportunities for both. By encouraging users to save songs directly to Spotify, the platforms can leverage this feature for targeted music promotions, playlists, and potentially introduce new premium features or partnerships, creating additional revenue streams.

People making a full-on living from social media? Less than 1% for sure. There’s a huge luck factor and the entire influencer space is saturated. Small to mid sized influencers are a dime a dozen (coming from a marketing agency standpoint).
---
i see a lot of people making money on social media, but they’re not necessarily “influencers” with millions of followers

a lot of them build a personal brand and, by being thought leaders, attract clients, sell products, offer consulting, and they don’t even need multiple viral videos

some do it with a website and ads, others with a facebook page of just 4K followers because they know exactly where their audience is. plenty of illustrators barely use anything besides instagram and a strong behance portfolio

I'd say less than 1% that try it actually succeed. 
You need a solid topic that has vast interest just to have  yourself seen.

I don't follow any of them but I do hear they collaborate with each other which boosts visibility. 

Persistence is key tho. You have to push through the lows where most people just give up.

There's no easy money and those who chase it fail 100%. Creators who make money have some kind of talents. They can be good at video editing, have good speaking skills, they like acting and singing, some of them do weird stuff to attract and keep the attention of their audience, or they are extremely handsome/beautiful, so people would watch whatever they do, some have a good taste in style, etc. Let's not forget the funny creators too. So, in any case, those who want to stand out, should find their niche, something they are good at and compete with the already existing creators. The competition is high, while our attention spans are at an all-time low.

Also, there are many different ways of making money. It's not only about getting brand deals. Many creators combine different strategies, including affiliate marketing, selling their products, selling courses, TikTok shops, UGC, etc. 

I have seen many creators with thousands of followers who can't make money. So, making money is also a skill that creators should learn.",2025-02-26 03:27:36,False

My son is 8 years old. But yesterday came home and kids at recess (same grade) were telling him things and joking that he wanted to do those things with some other kid on the playground. When my son said he didn’t know what that word meant, he got made fun of.    I had no idea about the birds and the bees until like 5th grade sex ed class.  
I really feel like a lot of the kids at school are just given unfiltered access to tik tok and YouTube because they are always repeating things that are trending on social media. 
My son took the talk well and it wasn’t weird at all and I reminded him he could always come to me with any questions and I made it clear that adults or other children should never ask him to touch him or he touch them etc.  but still, I feel like this happened wayyy sooner than it should have ?

---
I think why this seems too early for you is because of your own upbringing. Kids should not be learning about sex for the very first time from a teacher - I'm sure that may have been jarring to hear. Going into 5th grade they should know the basics from their parents/guardians. 

While yes, some kids do have more access than they should to things online, I'm betting a lot of them heard it from their parents. Kids should be learning appropriate genital names as young as 3, and each year a little more gets layered on. By 3rd/4th grade they should have a pretty good handle on how all that works. And it doesn't have to be graphic - they should just know the basics of ""this is how a baby is made.""
---
My girls knew more by 3rd grade than I did after my high school health class. We gave (and read) them “It’s Not The Stork” and “Sex Is a Funny Word.” There is no “The Talk;” it’s an on-going, age-appropriate conversation that happens whenever they have questions or when things come up that lead to good honest conversations.

You're fine. Don't sweat it. Seriously.

If you use those services and like them, keeping using them. Just have good security practices: strong password, 2FA, non-personal username, avoid sharing all your contacts with the app, don't comment or post random/personalized stuff, etc. Good security is the foundation of good privacy.

Otherwise, a lot of privacy boils down to what you're willing to share v.s. what services you use. No one knows anything about me because I have an anonymized TikTok that I never post or comment on, just watch a few videos sometimes. Maybe the company has scraped a bit of data from me, but oh well. I can still limit it, and my privacy is still practically intact. And if I have a more genuine concern, like Google Photos scanning photos, I can switch to a more privacy-friendly alternative like Ente.

Y'all are a bit too paranoid about this stuff.

if you are talking about the access and assistance act (2018) its even worse then that its give them the right to force in backdoors in to programs and hardware

Yes, unless you are okay with up to 2 years in prison. Depending on what you want to hide and the penalty for it, this could be worth it.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_disclosure_law#Australia

> The Cybercrime Act 2001 No. 161, Items 12 and 28 grant police with a magistrate's order the wide-ranging power to require ""a specified person to provide any information or assistance that is reasonable and necessary to allow the officer to ""access computer data that is ""evidential material""; this is understood to include mandatory decryption. Failing to comply carries a penalty of 6 months' imprisonment. Electronic Frontiers Australia calls the provision ""alarming"" and ""contrary to the common law privilege against self-incrimination.""[6]
> 
> The Crimes Act 1914, 3LA(5) ""A person commits an offence if the person fails to comply with the order. Penalty for contravention of this subsection: Imprisonment for 2 years.""[7]

They likely have fancy secret backdoors because this law doesn't deter everyone, but they don't even need them for most people. Just threaten prison and that is usually enough.

## HOWEVER

You can still have privacy while avoiding giving your data sometimes, e.g. by using a storage software like Veracrypt with Hidden Volumes, or by storing data abroad in a place the government does not know. Using the TOR browser also guarantees that the government cannot see what websites you visit (unless your computer itself is infected, in that case there is 0 privacy whatsoever).

Another option (bit more complex) involves setting up a web-browser (e.g. Firefox) or a VPN server on a VPS abroad, by yourself.

The companies could send over the encrypted string to circumvent that, and the government cannot decrypt it without it taking hundreds of years.

And if the company isn't based in Australia, the process is much more difficult if not impossible.

YouthRights,Australia under 16 social media ban,Why are there now all these proposed social media bans/age verifications,"There's long been a tendency for people to claim that the newest thing is highly detrimental to young people. As SCOTUS discussed in ""Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association"", this goes all the way back to at least the 1870s, when ""dime novels"" were supposed to be turning young people's brain to mush. Then, by the 1890s, the Puritans had stopped criticizing ""dime novels"" and had moved on to newer panics.

What's weird about this social media panic is that social media really isn't that new at this point, and this panic has gotten worse over time rather than better. That's contrary to every previous panic that I'm aware of.

There was an initial panic over social media circa 2005-2007 when MySpace was the main social media site. But even then, few people suggested that MySpace should be forced to ban anybody under 16 from the website or require a digital ID to verify everybody's age. The suggestions of that panic were moreso than MySpace should do things to make the site safer for minor users and/or parents should tell their kids to use Facebook rather than MySpace since Facebook was supposed to be safer. And that initial social media panic went away by 2010 at the latest. I barely remember anybody from about 2010-2021 expressing concern about minors on social media.

What's hardest to figure out is how  this panic came back and actually became worse than ever before around 2022 or 2023. I'm not aware of a similar thing happening with any past panic about a new technology with young people.

I struggle to understand exactly who this legislation is supposed to appeal to. Really, parents themselves already could have banned their kids from social media by using parental controls. The websites for the parental controls advertise their products as being meant for the parents of literal 5 year olds. However, that just further begs the question of who this social media legislation is supposed to appeal to- people only buy parental controls for literal 5 year olds, yet we're supposed to want government-enforced parental controls to interfere with internet usage for kids as old as 15.",26,7,DefinitionMelodic820,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/1gcmdr1/why_are_there_now_all_these_proposed_social_media/,2024-10-26 14:32:40,"It appeals to anyone who wants the ego boost of imposing things on other's, to anyone who wants to virtue signal they care about young people without actually doing anything meaningful or beneficial for anybody, a lot of people actually enjoy being condescending to youth, it's the last socially acceptable bigotry, it's frequently under the guise of care/protection and ironically it's harmful and dangerous.

iirc KOSA came from wanting to keep kids from seeing anything to do with transgender people. 

I think it’s because social media is an uncontrollable source of information. Kids on average are less indoctrination by standard american/western propaganda because they haven’t had as much time to absorb that information. Lawmakers are motivated to keep kids away from anti-american sentiment, anticapitalism, challenges to traditional gender, and other things that challenge them that kids sure won’t learn in school.
---
This is just due to desires for control and overprotection. This is just irrational fear which sadly, society as a whole is very prone to.

The US has bright spots such as gun rights and homeschooling rights, but the recent attacks on social media rights for minors is stupid. 

All this is just irrational fear.

I was born in 1998. Hit my teens in 2011 and started using YouTube and Facebook then. Had my first YouTube account at age 12 and my first Facebook account at age 13.

Here I am. 

In 2024, I am alive and well. 

Nothing happened to me.

This whole craze over social media is stupid. My guess is that we have too many control freaks and narcissists in society these days. 

Oh well. We have a narcissist vying for the presidency, Kamala Harris. She laughed about jailing parents of youths who skip school. 

The fact that vast numbers are voting for Kamala (and Trump is not ideal either) shows the character of society. Narcissistic.

SocialMedia,Australia under 16 social media ban,Is it time to rethink social media marketing?,"Social media has seen A LOT of changes this past year. From the potential TikTok ban to the introduction (and then removal) of fact-checking on Meta, it’s been a crazy ride. Are all these changes affecting the ability to reach users (and potential customers) organically? Are paid ads going to be the only way for businesses to grow on socials from here on out?

With paid social, you’re getting guaranteed visibility and easier hyper-targeting options to make audience segmentation easier. But costs keep rising, and if you don’t have the budget to keep ads going full-time, traffic will drop as soon as you stop spending.

We personally think organic still has merit. It helps build long-term brand credibility and community and it’s FREE, save for the time investment. However, it does require consistency, creativity, and even a little luck to get the needle moving.

A blend of both is usually our recommendation. Organic builds trust, and paid gives you reach—but is there a winning ratio?

>Are paid ads going to be the only way for businesses to grow on socials from here on out

Not without better metrics. The 'guaranteed' visibility isn't the selling point that companies like Meta thing it is, because while that price keeps rising, the clickthrough and conversion has been falling. Programmatic (which includes in-platform paid social) is really only worth it if you have enough invested in it, and that price is too prohibitive for most small businesses

>is there a winning ratio?

Social Media has seen a lot of changes this past year. And the year before, and the year before that. It is really starting to feel like the market fluxes quickly enough that by the time you're halfway through your run, the circumstances in which you bought the run have changed. 

Programmatic is, however, really good at retargeting. That means that it may not be the tool to *grow* audience, which sustained organic engagement is a better choice for, but might be a lot more effective in reaching existing audience
---
I believe that organic has merit - but I also work in news media where organic content is necessary. While I hope that capitalist consumption doesn't further erode the original purpose of these apps (to share and engage with others instead of shopping), I would be remiss to ignore the growing number of sponsored posts flooding my feeds. These days it seems like every 2-3 posts there is a new ad. 

Perhaps my love for organic content is just me clinging to the hope that people will find our content because it is something that interests them and, because of that, they will keep coming back. Wishful thinking.

I will say, with instagram specifically, I have noticed that organic has had some big hitters for us. But, I do think it is important to consider the market. News functions significantly different on social media than a normal business, especially since I work for an independent, free newspaper.

Just as an Instagram/Tiktok user - I will 100% scroll past every ad and paid/sponsored post I see.

I'm not on there to see ads and there are far too many.

I'm also seeing a introduction of stupid fake carousel ads now mainly on tiktok. It starts off with some semi controversial hook on the first post - then it's like stories or tips for a place. And one of the 'tips' is they use this specific shower head.... And then back to the tips... It's like a hidden ad in a post designed to look real. As soon as I see that though I lose all trust in it.

And as a content creator - I don't do much sponsored stuff on my own feed or UGC just now. But if it's an ad, just make it either be obvious it's an ad, or make it super creative so I don't mind watching it.

I see so many travel creators post stuff and then I'm the 'tips' video one is to get an e-sim (and you realize it's actually just an ad with an affiliate link). I lose all trust in that too.

She was given an iPhone by her bio mom. We have significant parental controls set up. No social media, limited screen time, etc. 
Our daughter made this friend from school who she texts frequently. We monitor conversations & have been uneasy with the friend. We also found out that the friend was previously expelled from school. 
We have put off ending this friendship for a handful of months now. We wanted our daughter to learn discernment & make the choice to distance herself from this friendship on her own. 

Unfortunately a recent event has shown us that our daughter is too influenced by this friend. She made a choice that not only broke our phone rules, but also could have gotten her in significant trouble at school for bullying. This choice was made at the encouragement of the friend. Our daughter is in control of her actions & has earned herself some consequences for her behavior, but it’s clear to us that this friend is a bad influence & we’re at the point where we need to intervene. 

My question: what’s the best way to go about this? Our daughter will undoubtedly be upset to lose this friendship, which we’re prepared to support her through. I’m concerned about approaching this in a way that won’t result in our daughter becoming a target for this soon-to-be ex-friend. My spouse & I have never been through this before, & we were never forbidden from certain friends by our parents when we were kids ourselves. I’m at a loss on how to handle this. 

TLDR: We are going to tell our 11 year old that she cannot continue a friendship with a bad influence any longer & are unsure the best way to go about it.

You could get your daughter involved in an activity outside of school. It will give her opportunities to make new friends.
---
My primary recommendation is to emphasize open dialogue that encourages your stepdaughter’s own discernment, rather than directly forbidding the friendship. Supporting this conversation with real-world examples and clear values can help her process why some friendships may need boundaries. Redirecting her social energy to healthier friendships, reinforcing phone rules, and providing a buffer for school interactions will further support this transition.

Start with a heartfelt conversation about values, using reflective questions to help her understand the impact of her choices. Reinforce phone boundaries while also creating new social opportunities to help her find friends who lift her up. This way, the shift feels empowering rather than punitive, allowing her to feel supported as she learns to make thoughtful decisions about relationships.

> **She** made a choice

Start here. 

She made the choices.

This is a multi tiered issue. I was like your daughter, and became close friends with kids who were bad influences. It cascaded through high school, and I wish my parents had helped me find a better path. I gravitated to those kids because I was ostracized by the popular girls and wasn't interested in being a theater kid or nerd. Please involve her in some things that will help her make other friends away from this girl. Sports and music are good options. 
Also, frame it as a natural consequence.  She made some poor decisions when she was around this girl, so now she needs to be around people who make better choices. If the other girl turns over a new leaf, you can cross that bridge when you come to it.",2024-11-11 19:08:24,False
AskParents,young people and social media ban,Do I wait until after a holiday to tell my children their aunt has died?,"Or do I even go on the holiday?

I found out about eight hours ago that my sister died completely unexpectedly and we don't even have a cause of death yet until the professionals have done their thing. I'm coping about as well as you'd expect, I think I'm still mostly numb with some short episodes of disbelief and snotty crying.

The point of the post really is that my two children (F9 and M7) are with their dad and I'm picking them up in twelve hours for their first holiday abroad. They are super super excited about going on a plane, the beach, activities etc, but... They don't know about their aunt passing away.

Their dad hasn't told them yet and neither have I. I'm not worried about them finding out by themselves as they have no access to social media or messaging apps, but I'm so stumped as to what the best option is now.

Do I 
a) wait until after the holiday to tell them
b) tell them and go on the holiday
c) tell them and not go on the holiday


I know that my daughter especially is going to be devastated as her and my sister had an incredibly close bond. My son cried for days and days after his cat died. It's going to hit them hard.

What do I do?

Ps. I know I'm going to seem really heartless and cold by asking about something as frivolous as a holiday. Most people in my family have said to still go as it's not going to change anything in the long run and it'd be a ""double whammy of sadness"" if they didn't get to go .

I am very lucky to have a wonderful and supportive partner who is happy to tag team with me if I need to go get some space for a bit if it gets a bit much while away. The holiday is for four nights.

I'm not thinking straight. Please help me. Has anyone else here been in this situation? 😞",25,34,bekkins,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskParents/comments/1g6mubi/do_i_wait_until_after_a_holiday_to_tell_my/,2024-10-18 16:50:29,"Thank you u/bekkins for posting on r/AskParents.

Tell them. I'm a believer that it's better to be honest with children. Plus, they'll want to know why you are sad and upset.
---
Firstly, I am sorry to hear about what you’re going through.

I would tell them before you go because they will have a holiday to soften the blow slightly and provide a distraction while they deal with the initial shock. Otherwise they will be coming back from a great time to the horrible news that will undo the holiday.

Whatever you decide to do, I hope all goes well and you manage to enjoy the time as best you can.

Thank you everybody so much for your kind and thoughtful replies. I'm sorry that I haven't got the mental capacity right now to reply to you all individually but please know that I appreciate you all. 


It seems the general consensus is to go still and I'm going to tell them really soon. To the commenter that gave some tough love and said I shouldn't underestimate my children's abilities, you're right. They are so resilient and always fill me with pride when they deal with difficult issues.

I think I just needed you all to be my brain and my emotions while I'm struggling to even remember how to put one foot in front of the other. I especially like the idea to do something special to remember her and that there can be more than one emotion at a time. 

I'll trust the process and I know it gets easier with time. I lost my mum when she was only 43, and I'm getting scarily close to that age now! My beautiful little sister Holly would be 31 in November. It's not fair but it'll be okay.

I've already got the school on board with counsellors for them and I'm looking into local therapists for them to help process. I have good access to counselling through work which I'm going to access.

I guess this whole garbled wall of text is just to say thank you for being my conscience and my rational side and my emotional side and... Everything.


Thank you.

Parenting,kids off social media,"Bullies, Therians and Therapy","EDIT:
We’ve spoken with her and talked about how we manage unkind words said to us, she says she’s being bullied for being bi and therian and we’ve talked over how to address that in the correct way. We also talked about how that doesn’t excuse her behaviour towards others. Just because someone is unkind to you or a friend doesn’t mean you can do the same. 

I also think I should have clarified the social media. She has WhatsApp. No facebook, Snapchat, TikTok etc. she doesn’t have free roaming access to the internet either. Everything is age restricted. 

She has a doctors appointment next week which unfortunately is the best we can do due to the inner workings of the NHS. But I’m hopeful that they will see she needs some support that we clearly can’t offer or she doesn’t want from us and refer her for a psychological assessment.

The phone is more restricted than before now and the school are speaking with the other friends parents who will hopefully have the same conversations with their children as we did with ours.

Good lord where to start…… 
So I had an email from the school today regarding some unkind messages my soon to be 12 y/o has been sending to other students via WhatsApp. 

They didn’t go into detail so when she got home I’ve had a look at her phone and I’m just ovewhelmed at what’s on there. 

Not only is she incredibly nasty a spiteful to the people she labels friends but she is even more cruel to people she dislikes. So many names and swear words which I expected but there’s entire group chats dedicated to being mean to people. 
The school has even had a parent make a complaint about these group chats. They are all made with upbeat and casual names so you wouldn’t even know the purpose of them is to inflict verbal abuse on each other. 

I spoke with her regarding the way we speak to and treat people and she says that these people are unkind to her and her friends at school. I’ve told her I’m not completely buying that because the way she is portrayed in these messages makes her look like a willing participant in unprovoked attacks. It’s not just her and I understand in some ways she may be goaded into thinking it’s justified but Jesus these kids are savage!! 

We then opened up a more interesting root cause of this. She declares she is a bisexual therian. I’ve had to look up therian because I had no idea that this is essentially a sub species of a furry. A therian is a furry that cannot be controlled apparently. 

I’m really trying to get my head around that one because it’s thrown me off completely! 
It would seem that in her innocence she has announced her proud bisexuality(incredible move) and her proud therian nature and neither have gone down as smoothly as she expected they would.

She’s then taken to posting horrifically depressing and graphic status updates on WhatsApp about how she wants to die, how she wants to hurt herself or others and how she feels everyone hates her. 

I’m just in complete shock. I do find myself longing for a day without social media, phones and the desire to be popular. I’m sure my generation was just as difficult but the access to phones has bred an incredibly toxic nature among young children.

We’ve now contacted the GP for some kind of mental health support because she clearly needs someone to talk to and doesn’t feel like she can speak to us. 

It’s been an eye opening 12 hours at what pre teen life is like for the average year 7 student. Wish us luck for the teenage years…..

",24,43,The_Dowager,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1gr8plh/bullies_therians_and_therapy/,2024-11-14 16:28:14,"As someone with experience in the Furry space a long time ago, there is a certain segment of that group that loves to wallow in self pity, no one understands them because they are different, and they all one-up each other on how depressed/suicidal/etc they are. Similar groups also exist in the anime fandom.

Its a toxic echo chamber.

On the one hand folks sometimes turn to it because they are not getting validation and love at home.
---
Her sex/gender identity has nothing to do with her being nasty. Take away the phone, don't let her get into social media, and ignore the ""bi therian"" red herring. By all means get her mental health support, but you the parent can help by removing her opportunity to cyberbully.
---
She needs to have access to any social media taken away. Take away the smartphone and get her an old school flip phone. First, because she isn't using it responsibly when he bullies people, and second because she's pretty clearly picking up some very hateful attitudes at least from the others she's bullying with and probably from the rest of the internet as well.

I'd add that she's probably in some very weird and unsafe spaces  if she's decided she's therian, but it's possible it's a fad within her friend group. Furries can totally be normal nice people but the internet culture around it gets really inappropriate really quickly.

I would make it clear to her that you love her no matter what, regardless of identity, but that doesn't give her a pass to be mean to others.

When you take away the social media you are going to need to find other outlets for her to replace it with. Structured family time like going on walks and having dinner together would probably help. Maybe an after school art class, music lessons, joining martial arts, or whatever she picks so that she can still be social and get some stress out in a productive way. You don't want her just sitting in her room ruminating on how mean her parents are and thinking of ways to be destructive.

not only that. they'll agree the youth in question are groomed by other adults, or got indoctrinated by them including by right wingers, but them proceeds to harass them seconds later just cus they're pro censorship. which is victim blaming to start off. the normies in the anti censorship movement aren't even anti censorship or anti harassment since as a person who got themselves all wrapped up into this discourse before deciding to stray away from it. 

i've seen them chastise teens from expressing themselves sexually, for having hormones, knowing sex ed or exploring their sexuality/kinks and harass them if they own a private nsfw account where they aren't even uploading csem to begin with. there's literal ppl posting csem on twitter and minors getting groomed but yeah, sure, let's shun, alienate and harass minors for knowing what sex and kinks are and exploring them privately /s

i've also saw them being ableist towards mentally ill people & youth as well or racist too but them blame youth for also being some other form of bigot too when bigotry is taught or influenced and not inherented. the fact the normies were also the same people and are the same generation that would lie about their ages to be accepted by other adults, sneak into nsfw spaces or websites at a young age to look at porn, or go to pride by themselves to look at queer ppl wearing kink gear when they were teenagers and not magically adults too.

i literally don't know what happened as throughout most of the history of the reactionary pro censorship and pro cringe culture crowd. most people who were for censorship and believed in cringe culture were adults who hated tumblr to begin with (which is funny bc tumblr was full of RWers and still is in the present day). and they kicked off the 2020s decade by spreading their right wing ideology even further, by going as far as to groom youth as well, and developing online echo chambers and cults. and nobody blamed youth online until now

**One month after dead fish washed up on beaches outside Hobart, Anthony Albanese will amend environmental laws to protect the salmon farming industry in Tasmania.**

**Crystal Andrews, Mar 24, 2025**

Anthony Albanese is expected to introduce an amendment to the *Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act* on Tuesday to protect Tasmania’s salmon farming industry from legal challenges by environmental groups. It will be the latest in a barrage of developments since [dead salmon began washing up on Tasmanian beaches](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-21/salmon-chunks-decomposing-fish-dumped-copping/104965402) in late February, putting what might have been a niche issue [firmly in the federal election spotlight](https://www.crikey.com.au/2025/01/28/peter-george-franklin-tasmania-election-salmon-farming/).

Labor is calling for the Coalition to support the bill, which is a response to an ongoing review of salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour on Tasmania’s west coast. However, it will have much broader implications, such as limiting the capacity of conservation groups to [“challenge past decisions that have allowed developments to go ahead”](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/19/albanese-to-rush-through-new-laws-to-protect-tasmanias-salmon-industry-from-legal-threat).

To help you follow the salmon trail, this is how we got here. 

# October 16, 2024

Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek travels to Tasmania with Albanese and visits the first Maugean Skate hatchling born as part of the captive breeding program at the University of Tasmania’s Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies. An earlier [media release](https://www.tanyaplibersek.com/media/media-releases/maugean-skate-born-in-captivity-brings-hope-for-ancient-species) notes the skate’s population has “almost halved in the past decade” in Macquarie Harbour. The statement acknowledges that the harbour is the only place it still exists, and that the breeding program will “help make sure the Maugean Skate will survive for generations to come”.

“We’ll keep working with industry, environmentalists and the Tasmanian government on restoring the health of the harbour,” Plibersek said in the statement.

# October 29

Plibersek delays making a decision on the endangered status of the Maugean Skate, pushing back the deadline [a full year to October 30, 2025](https://tasmaniantimes.com/2024/10/skate-decision-booted-to-beyond-election/) — after the federal election. The status of the skate is the central factor in the review of whether salmon farming can continue in Macquarie Harbour, which at this point had already been [“under review” by the Environment Department for 12 months](https://australiainstitute.org.au/post/tide-of-public-opinion-supports-stopping-fish-farming-in-macquarie-harbour/).

This review was requested by conservation groups in November 2023, who asked the government to reassess Macquarie Harbour salmon farming against the *EPBC Act*.

# February 15, 2025

Albanese [writes a letter to industry lobby group Salmon Tasmania](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-15/prime-minister-salmon-farming-tasmania-legisaltion-change/104941226) (whose chairman is former PM John Howard’s nephew, Lyall) promising to change environmental laws for their benefit. In the letter, Albanese says: “My commitment to you, your employees, suppliers and the community is that salmon farming operations on Macquarie Harbour will continue and that no jobs will be lost.”

Salmon Tasmania claims the industry provides 5,000 jobs, [including 120 at the Macquarie Harbour farms](https://salmontasmania.au/macquarieharbour/), but this number has not been independently verified and is [disputed](https://australiainstitute.org.au/post/60-jobs-the-salmon-industry-finally-comes-clean/).

A short time later, the Bob Brown Foundation releases images of dead and decomposing fish [floating on the surface of pens](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-20/dead-salmon-in-tasmanian-fish-pens/104954444) just five kilometres away in Surveyors Bay. Huon Aquaculture confirms a disease outbreak caused a mass mortality event killing thousands of salmon, and that it had begun vaccinating salmon the week prior.

# March 7

The disease outbreak is confirmed to have killed at least 1 million fish, which “were dumped at landfill sites and rendering plants”. The Environment Protection Authority says it is the largest die-off the industry has ever seen.

The Bob Brown Foundation releases drone footage of workers at a farm in the D’Entrecasteaux Channel [sealing live and dead fish in tubs](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/08/million-salmon-dumped-in-landfill-after-unprecedented-mass-death-of-at-tasmanian-fish-farms-ntwnfb), prompting RSPCA Australia to suspend Huon Aquaculture’s “RSPCA Approved” certification. [In a statement](https://www.rspca.org.au/latest-news/media-centre/rspca-australia-statement-on-certification-of-huon-aquaculture/), the RSPCA says the suspension will be in place for 14 days while it investigates the “inhumane handling of live, sick or injured fish”.

Protests, which have been ongoing in Tasmania for at least a year, begin picking up steam. On March 17, [more than 2,000 people attend a protest at Verona Sands](https://tasmanianinquirer.com.au/news/mass-protest-against-pollution-of-southern-tasmanian-waterway-with-rotting-salmon-waste/), the beach where salmon waste was first spotted.

RSPCA [withdraws certification of Huon Aquaculture](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-20/rscpa-withdraws-certification-for-huon-salmon/105077004). Huon was the only manufacturer to have certification. 

Journalist Nick Feik reveals Plibersek [received advice in November 2023](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/75613-1.pdf) that the government should undertake consultation to review salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour and across Tasmania generally.

The invention of agriculture 10,000 year ago was not simple.  However the technological and social impact on humanity was massive.

Fish farming is not a mature, sustainable, scalable, system.

My understanding is that the environmentally safest solution is to have onshore tanks with fish, with managed flows between those tanks and the sea.

There are a number of economic and technical challenges that need to be overcome to make this a reality.

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/15/first-large-scale-uk-onshore-salmon-project-at-risk-over-factory-farm-claimss

What I see as the way forward is for the government to establish and fund a company establish this industry, and for the government to also fund the R&D, via universities and CSIRO, to solve harder technical issues.

This is risky, expensive, and may take time.

But it is also building on our strengths as a nation, and the payoffs are massive.
---
So here we have 1 million dead fish in the largest die-off the EPA has ever seen, an endangered native species whose status is still pending assessment by Plibersek, and yet Albanese is promising multinational fishing companies that he'll rush through a weakening Australia's environment laws with the LNP's support.

For the first time in history, you can get access to any information you want that can discredit your government's own information (ie, propaganda) at the press of a button.

This became a problem for western governments during the Israel-Palestine conflict, where decades of western propaganda was dismantled over the course of a few weeks. It was our relatively free access to social media that helped expose millions of people to information that gave them new perspectives on a conflict that has, in the past, been somewhat black-and-white for the average person.

I believe that this social media panic is getting worse because governments have an interest in placing restrictions on internet usage broadly, but they can't outright say it — when a government wants to control what its entire population does, it tells them that control/restrictions will benefit the youth and most people don't question it.

Australia (the vanguard of the social media panic) has a controversial history in regards to arresting people for what they say and do online, and have arrested people for what they've said on social media in relation to the Israel-Palestine conflict. It therefore stands to reason that if we enter a world where you have to hand over your ID to use social media, it'll be easier for these kinds of governments to know who's saying what online, for the purpose of making arrests.

Probably not. I grew up in a millenia where there was an anti-furry moral panic teaching parents that their kids will grow up to be hypersexual deviants and bestiality freaks for simply watching Looney Tunes one day and then feeling connected to those kinds of characters enough the next day to want to celebrate it a-la Space Jam. It wasn't that many years ago where trans people, and sometimes the LGBs were slandered as being flipping ""groomers"" and ""pedophiles"" by simply teaching children that LGBT people exist, and when approximately 1% of those kids turned out to be trans after learning there was a word for what they are, suddenly they're ""trans-ing the kids!!1!"" Now, you're not allowed to teach true American history in schools and books teaching black history are being banned for being considered ""CRT."" You're only allowed to teach kids propaganda about how unquestionably awesome the United States is with none of that anti-black racism, or anti-French hatred with a side of Freedom Fries, how much worse anti-Asian hate has become post-covid, and we must believe that Hatian Americans/immigrants are stealing our pets so they can kill and eat them.

I can only make a few educated guesses on what might be next.

They have also told me that they have been left out and seen as a weird kid for not understanding any trends due to the absence of social media. My child has even told me that they are viewed as a loser to some who doesn’t have social media and doesn’t get any references.

All of the kids in my child’s grade seem to turn out fine with social media but I’m not quite sure. Should I or should I not?

Last year, the surgeon general put out an advisory against social media for kids in the same way that they have one against smoking and drugs. The research is conclusive and consistent— kids who use social media have lower self esteem, higher anxiety, higher rates of depression, are more likely to experience bullying, etc etc. I have no doubt there are anecdotal examples about some kids being just fine. But those are similar to the idea that some people can use cocaine and still hold a steady job, but they are by far the exception. See the link below for specifics. It’s also easily googled if a summary is better for you. 

There are absolutely other ways kids can stay connected to friends. My daughter uses FaceTime and that’s sufficient for her for now. It gets much harder as they get older, but it really is for their own good. I’m ok with being the uncool/too harsh dad if it means my kid is less likely to have an eating disorder or depression for the next ten years.

HARD no.

I have a GS troop I work with and since they were 12-14ish their problems grew in stakes significantly. 

They went from talking about their interests and hobbies and started talking about their peers getting into legal trouble because they sent a nude photo and it is consider child pornography.

No way. I have seen a number of kids spiral into a deep depression because of this. It is not worth it. This is when the phrase just say no is very important. It is hard to be apparent, but this is a hill to die on.

SocialMedia,age verification social media Australia,A full-blown social media scheduler on Google Sheets,"I run a boutique SM marketing agency and this is what our process looks like:

1. Create social media content (probably the toughest bit, need information/creatives from clients, a lot of Canva, a little bit of Illustrator, some ChatGPT)
2. Put all the images and media on Google Drive and all the text into a Google Sheets
3. Sometimes our clients like to have a look, mostly they do not. Regardless, all of it is in Sheets as it helps us in planning.
4. Take ALL that content and put that into Hootsuite/Later/whatever. We've used different schedulers at different times.

I knew there was a gap. The transferring of content from Sheets to a scheduler seemed redundant and a lot of wasted manpower. I mean sure there are things that a scheduler does that Sheets cannot, but really the main value add for me was just scheduling. Didn't need anything fancy.

I'm not a tech guy, but I got in touch with a friend who was. And we built a scheduler on top of Google Sheets. It does what it says, nothing more nothing less.

1. Put your content into Google Sheets. Images in Google Drive.
2. Fire up the Google Sheets extension. Hit ""Schedule Posts"" and that's that.

There are some cool things in there that I'm quite proud of. Stuff like, typing in English to set up a date/time to schedule (eg. ""tomorrow 4 pm) and also the ability to schedule multiple stories together on Instagram (AFAIK most standalone schedulers don't have this lol).

We've gone through both Google and Meta verification and we're finally at a place where I think we can share what we have with folks.

BTW there is another ""scam"" the schedulers had that I was annoyed with and wanted to fix. Charging by number of social media accounts or channels. THAT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. In our Google Sheet scheduler you can add as many accounts as you like, **no limit.**

I would love love if you guys could try it out and share feedback. I promise you, you will be our early users so we'll do whatever you want in a matter of hours or a day or two at most

Only Instagram support right now. We can bring more based on what folks want in the future.

This is a super cool project, especially for scaling multiple IG accounts at once without the usual calendar bloat.

YouthRights,Australia under 16 social media ban,I'm really disappointed by Canada's recent backtracking on Youth Rights,"Various governments in Canada have taken action or signaled an intent to limit the rights of youth. You can read about here:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_713
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parents%27_Bill_of_Rights
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_rights_in_Canada#Pronouns_in_Schools

This started in 2023. Prior to 2023, Canada had been making consistent, slow growth in youth rights. For example, starting in 2019 various governments in Canada took steps to limit statutory parental authority. Most provinces and all territories do not have an age required for children to independently consent to medical treatment. 2 provinces and 1 territory presume all people to be capable of consent to medical treatment. 

There was clear trend away from age-based restrictions and using an individual's own capacity instead. However, this was done away with when New Brunswick decided to amend Policy 713 to require parental consent for names and pronouns for students under 16. And then Saskatchewan decided to did the same thing, while also limiting access to sex-ed and providing that these laws apply notwithstanding sections 2, 7 and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, shown below:

>2 Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms:
>
>    (a) freedom of conscience and religion;
>
>    (b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication;
>
>   (c) freedom of peaceful assembly; and
>
>    (d) freedom of association.

...

>Life, liberty and security of person
>
>7 Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.

...

>Equality before and under law and equal protection and benefit of law
>
>    15 (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.
>
>    Affirmative action programs
>
>    (2) Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.

And now Alberta wants to in addition to everything Saskatchewan's doing ban minors from receiving certain treatments until children turn 16 and ban them from receiving some other treatments until they turn 18. 

These decisions have reignited support for age based-requirements and I fear that this could lead to more ageist requirements being introduced, while progress continues to stall on removing ageist requirements (not seeing major changes since the mid-2000s).",22,2,DarkDetectiveGames,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/1augp3n/im_really_disappointed_by_canadas_recent/,2024-02-19 06:34:13,"We are living in an age of rising fascism worldwide.

In the US, you have to be 26 to rent a car. The US has very little public transport outside of specific cities, so for most americans no car means no freedom.

When there isn’t decent public transportation, preventing people from driving can be life-ruining and we should be making it as easy as possible for young people to get cars so that they can start living their lives

Australia was sold out years ago. The huge multinational companies that the average Australian are forced to deal with in a daily basis are essentially able to tell the Gov what to do and what not to do. 

All of the privacy laws and regulations we have only affect you and I. Small businesses will be destroyed for breaching these, big business however make their own rules and are essentially immune to prosecution. And the donations they make to political parties and the resulting corruption etc ensure no one would ever try.

If your local bakery kept a database of customers details. Name, addresses, drivers licence photos etc and kept all of these on an unsecured network connected PC and the lot was stolen and placed online, they would be financially destroyed. The individual responsible would be prosecuted, the business would be closed down and the lawsuits would likely total millions of dollars.

When a Gov department (like recently, the department of education) health insurance companies, or a company like Optus (owned offshore) does the same, it's a case of oops, sucks to be you ha... 

Full immunity from the law, a few members of Parliament engage in a circle jerk and talk about stricter penalties but outside influence ensures nothing ever changes, the media gets bored and moves to a different story, and then rinse and repeat, the same thing happens again a few months later...

Most media is made in southern California, where the age of consent is, in fact, 18.

Trying to make sense of it myself. (Made my own post on this sub only a week ago)

I think it's because the legal adulthood age itself is 18, so while 17 and 21+ may be legal, thar 17-year-old is still technically a minor, so socially they're still seen as such.
---
Some states set the age of consent at 18 (in the US, at least).

But keep in mind that in virtually all US states (and all countries), the age of majority/legal adulthood is 18 years of age, and at 18, you are considered a legal adult in all matters and free to make your decisions. You are emancipated from parental control and authority, which makes it all the more easier.

Yes, the age of consent might be 16-17 years old in some states, but in virtually all jurisdictions, you are considered a legal minor at those ages which means that SOMEBODY has legal guardianship of you; this can make things difficult because your legal guardian can coerce/force you to do things such as break up or restrict your freedom of movement.

18 is considered legal adult; you not only can consent to sex but have full adult decision-making rights and freedoms. You no longer have to deal with legal guardians meddling in your relationship and yes, legal guardians, as long as they have custody over you, can make your life pretty miserable. 

But yes, 17 and 20 is definitely much smaller than 18 and 30.

Parenting,young people and social media ban,Guilt about potentially having only one kid,"So I’ve always thought I wanted at least 2 kids, same with my wife. However me her and our 14 month old were chilling on the couch yesterday and I just got to thinking about how perfect everything is right now. We are able to dedicate all of our love, attention, and resources to our son. I got to thinking that I may not have enough love in my heart to spread it out with another kid to where they both get an appropriate amount of love and attention. 

We also are both lucky to have great careers and make a good income separately and a great one combined, and with one kid we aren’t stretched too thin to where we can still travel, have nice things, get our kid stuff, and not be stretched too thin. It’s also much easier to find childcare for one kid if we want to have a date night or maybe one day when he’s older go on a trip with just us or something. On top of that we’re pretty young (me being 24 and her being 27) so we would be kid free fairly early in life and be able to rekindle our marriage (our marriage is great now but you do sacrifice part of it when you have a kid).

I brought the idea of having one kid up to my wife last night about having one kid. She said that she would be fine with it, but her concern was that most only children she knows of have something off with them. Even if they are social, there’s just something off. She gave me some examples, but I pointed out how those people had something wrong with their upbringing whether it be an absent parent physically or emotionally or otherwise.

My concern is, is I don’t want to deprive my child of potentially having a close bond with their sibling and growing up with someone that will always have their back. Especially when a good bit of my reasoning for not wanting to have a second child is selfish on my end. And when me and my wife pass, especially if our son opts not to marry, he would have no family left other than potentially some cousins. He could very well end up, not even having a bond with his sibling like me and my sister, we don’t share much of a bond, we’re more so acquaintances, even though I do love her. But I have met siblings that are very close in the fact that he could have that it makes me feel bad, not giving that to him if I can. 

Mine and my wife’s initial plan was actually to try for another kid this month after we had our first but now that the time is here and I have the family I have I’m debating on if I need or want more. But at the same time I don’t want to put myself over my son. Let me know what you guys think. Thanks",21,75,YaBoiCade,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1jwoeq5/guilt_about_potentially_having_only_one_kid/,2025-04-11 12:16:17,"i’m going to copy and paste my response to a similar question:

i grew up with two older sisters and they destroyed my self esteem and my entire childhood.

My husband was a single child who yes may have been a bit lonely but he had a super loving family, lots of friends, and a really great childhood.

I have almost no contact with any of my family and we see and talk to hubbies family regularly.

Just because they have siblings doesn’t automatically mean they’ll have some magical connection. Everyone’s going to be different but if you ask me which childhood i would have preferred it certainly wouldn’t have involved siblings.

Ultimately, do what’s best for your family, don’t feel forced into more kids if you don’t want them.
---
The only child stereotype is false—there is a lot of research in psychology to support this. Only children become well functioning adults at the same rate as children with siblings. There is also research showing that parents of only children (especially mothers, who most of the research has been conducted on) are happier than parents of multiples. This is not to say that having an only child is necessarily the right choice for your family, and there are certainly benefits to having a close sibling relationship as you describe. However, I thought I’d share to hopefully alleviate the (unnecessary) fears about the outcomes of being an only child!
---
One thing about parenting is that you’re going to feel guilt no matter what you choose. Instead of being pushed around by guilt and fear, think about what you want to achieve, what would be the ideal future that you picture for your family five, ten years down the road. 

Siblings aren’t guaranteed to get along. Only kids can have full and happy lives and have their own chosen families. Love is unlimited - if you have another, you will find that you can love them just as much. It definitely helps to have siblings when parents grow old and need more help, and to grieve together when you pass, but you can mitigate that by saving for retirement. 

That is to say that whatever route you choose, it will have its own advantages and disadvantages that you can mitigate. I don’t think there’s a right answer here.
---
Head over to r/oneanddone lots of good info. We are, by our own decision, one and done due to many of the same sentiments you have expressed, especially not being able to share time and love between two. I do look at my son and often think that he would be such a good big brother and that a sibling would be so fun for him. But then I think about how he has a lot of friends, and I always make plans for him. Additionally, we don’t want to have a second just to give him someone to play with. we believe in being able to give our son experiences that we wouldn’t necessarily be able to give him if we had multiple, ie: trips, a car when he starts driving, paying for college- if he chooses to attend, going all out for birthdays. 
It’s a big decision and you are still young. I look at my family and know that I have everything I could ever possibly need. If you both also feel that way, then you have your answer. Not an easy decision to make, but once you make the choice either way, you will know in your heart that it’s the right one

Parenting,kids off social media,In laws trying to convert/“save” our kids,"Just hosted my in-laws who came for my daughter’s graduation. To make a long story short they are evangelical Christian and we are not. Most of my husband’s extended family is also religious and we have an evangelical pastor in the family too. We are the most progressive of the lot and despite differences in religion and politics we are respectful of each others’ opinions and give each other space to express ourselves. 

Over the years family members have given our kids the occasional religious themed thing (illustrated kids bible, pocket New Testament etc) and it has bothered me but not nearly as much as this past weekend. I tell the kids they are free to read / review what my family / in-laws give to them and make their own decisions about it. I explain to the kids that their grandparents are doing it from their deeply held religious beliefs / desire to “save” their grandchildren and that some people feel it is important to share their religious beliefs with others. So my kids graciously accept these things although don’t use /believe them. My daughter intentionally doesn’t share things about her identity with our extended family as it would “probably cause them distress” - her words. 

So this past weekend my in-laws gave our kids some cards with a free bible app at the dinner table (literally trying to convert them in from of us) and then as soon as we left the building from my daughter’s graduation they presented her with another religious item (a pocket book of psalms). It was clearly intended as tied to the graduation. They didn’t even say anything like “we’re proud of you” or likewise. Just plopped this into her hands. It really felt like it ruined the moment. 

They don’t try to preach at the kids directly, don’t cut them off for different views, they treat them kindly, they honestly don’t approach it like an adversarial thing and are generally very kind people …, but it just really rubbed me and my daughter the wrong way. In my daughter’s words “it feels like I’m just a project to them and they don’t really want to actually know me”. 

My daughter would like us to pass on to them that she would prefer to not receive gifts like this. I’ll ask my husband if he’d like to bring it up with them but I’m guessing it might need to be something I do (sometimes you need a bit of distance with these touchy topics - my husband helped be a lot with struggles I had with my Dad so that’s totally ok). I’m trying to think of the best way to word things. I was going to mention how hurtful it is (and I even thought to mention how hurtful it was the time the first words from my MIL’s mouth after my mother died in the icu while I was pregnant were “do you know if she believed?” 😨) But I’ve thought twice about that and feel like it might make things worse. So now I’m thinking to approach it more from what my daughter said and just emphasize that the kids want to spend time with their grandparents without feeling pressure and that they are old enough to make their decisions about ethics, religion etc on their own. 

Thoughts?

I don’t have a lot of ppl to talk this through (no siblings, both parents deceased, if I post on social media it will get through the family grapevine somehow even if exclude certain family members).",21,16,Hot_Stick_1040,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1kvdgsp/in_laws_trying_to_convertsave_our_kids/,2025-05-25 21:23:07,"Welcome to r/Parenting!

I would just tell them that daughter has asked not to give these gifts any longer. If they have a problem with that, refer them to your husband. And tell your daughter that she is allowed to say no thank you, and not accept these gifts. 

The thing is though, it probably won’t stop them. Evangelical Christianity is a proselytizing religion. The whole point is to convert others. So, “perfectly lovely people” are going to continue to stomp on your boundaries in the name of their religion.

Now is the time you talk to them and tell them what you expect from future visits and interactions.

Tell them to knock it off. 

They expect you to respect their beliefs and what they feel is right for *them*, and you need to absolutely insist they respect your beliefs and what you feel is right for your family. 

We had to do this with my parents, and it was tough because we have a great relationship otherwise. But the main message was, ""*You* may believe my children are sinners who need to be saved from hell, but I simply don't, and I think that's a horrible message to teach to impressionable young children. Regardless of what your church says, it is not your place to convert my children. Your conduct, your works, will be what draws them in, if anything. If they come to you with questions, I'm OK with you answering them. But until then, I do not want you offering religious instruction to my kids. Period."" And then enforce as necessary. 

Make sure your kids know that churches are generally toxic. ""There are a few christians who really truly live the way they should, they really show what the idea of God's love should be, but many don't. I don't want you exposed to that until you're much older and can evaluate if what you're hearing is the truth or not.""

YouthRights,social media harm to teens,Opinion on Age Restrictions on Media?,"Alright so.. age restrictions or recommendations.. think PEGI, ESRB, MPAA, FSK, Kijkwijzer Etc. they are something mundane but i have a pet peeve with them..

They are in place to ""Protect"" children from ""not age appropriate"" content like Gross Violence, Drugs or god forbid a Booba.. now my biggest question is why? what is ""Age Appropriate?"" are people under a arbitrary age too dumb to understand something? because that's a broad over-generalization.. 

For Example.. I saw a youtube documentary on some convention, now it had mentions of the Far-Right, Abuse and (might i add, brief) descriptions of Sexual Abuse.. Now anyone normal can agree that these are heavy subjects that many may not be comfortable with.. But why does the Docu have to be for ""Persons over 18 Only"".. are 17 year old's too idiotic to understand such subjects while the biologically and emotionally identical 18 year old's are wise and know everything?.. A Minor above like.. 13 has the full capacity to at least grasp the topics at hand, while a person in their 20's might not be able to grasp anything! Is it because it might harm the minor? well it can harm a adult too so that's out the window.. Also what are you protecting the ""Children"" from? the real world? I Know in America anyone under 18 is treated like a baby but here is Europe 16 and 17 year old have Jobs and pay tax, hell they can even vote in certain places.. are they emotionally smart enough to work a job but too dumb to understand S.A.?

Also back to the actual Organisations like the ESRB, some of them are very arbitrary..

For example, The Hunger Games got rated PG-13, T.H.G. has a lot of violence in it.. While the Comedy Harold and Kumar go to White Castle got a R because it included Weed, a drug that in most western nations is regular, and a few topless women.. god for bid a 15 year old see the body of a woman, something that is only sexual because of the ""Sex Sells"" mantra Capitalism perpetrates, but death? that's fine!

Same with PEGI, Balatro a Video Game that is **INSPIRED** by poker got a 18+ Rating by PEGI because it looked like poker.. Mind you Balatro has no actual gambling in it, you buy the game and that is it.. While FIFA 23 a game with **actual real gambling** got a rating of **3+... 3+.. so Capitalism has a effect on these too, making them even more nonsensical** 

Also, i saw a indie game which i will not name that is a Horror Visual Novel.. the devs gave it a 18+ only marker because of ""violence and drugs"".. But why 18+? just put the warning and move on with your day!

Ironically PEGI already has a really good system.. these things.. It says exactly what you can expect with the piece of media you are consuming.. you just need a number system and you are ready to go.. take this mock up

You'd have the warning and then a Number in a ladder of 1-5 or 1-10, for example this is the Bad Language warning, and a rating of 3.. in a 1-5 ladder system this would be the equivalent to the current PG-13 rating so.. lighter swears like ""Damn!"" ""Shit!"" and maybe one or two ""Fuck!""'s.. now the Consumer be it the Minor, Adult or Guardian/Parent can make up their own decision Whether this piece of media is appropriate, Whether you can handle it..  No need for arbitrary age restrictions!

I think it's much less infantilizing.. What's your opinion on them?",21,9,lokovec,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/1kyao8j/opinion_on_age_restrictions_on_media/,2025-05-29 13:22:42,"You're allowed to work from age 14 in most if not all US states, let alone 16 or 17. However, the laws limit your  hours until age 18, and you're unlikely to get a job that pays much higher than minimum wage until at least age 22 or so.

It is pretty hard to understand how all these states have a working age of 14, yet are setting ages of 16 or even 18 to use social media.
---
The age ratings are definitely arbitrary and in my opinion do nothing to ""protect minors"". Instead, it poses a gateway to more harm and infantilization towards minors. According to the National Youth Rights Association, these content classifications prevent young people from learning about ""adult"" concepts in content in an educational and responsible way, and that all these ""explicit content"" warnings can incite feelings in young people that the type of content present in this type of media is mysterious, and therefore desirable, giving the young person a chance to consume the content secretly away from anyone in power.

Part of my issue with them is that they pretend to be something they’re not. Take a look at the first paragraph of the BBFC’s “about us” page, for instance:

*At the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), our focus is on helping children and families choose well by providing them with the guidance they need to help them choose what’s right for them and avoid what’s not.*

No, you’re not “helping children and families choose”, you’re taking the choice away from the consumer and making it for them. No, you’re not “providing them with guidance”, you’re providing them with **legal restrictions**. No, you’re not “helping them choose what’s right for them”, you’re imposing your own idea on what’s “right” for someone else and enforcing it through law. Big fucking difference. It’s all euphemistic doubletalk.

If it really *were* just guidance, fair enough. I could use it. Sometimes I don’t want to watch a bloodfest, even though I’m “old enough” to. But it’s not, so it can fuck right off.

At least things like MPAA ratings don't have the force of law so people are free ignore them if they wish.  That being said, I do agree with many of the criticisms above and think that media ratings should not be tied to age.

When I was 15 or so, it pissed me OFF that Persona 3 was rated 17+ but actually had a protagonist under 17 (16, to be specific) and not only that, having played the game myself, I knew that it featured nothing more extreme than what I already dealt with in my daily life on a regular basis - thoughts of suicide, adults who abuse and exploit children, the meaning of mortality etc. Doubly so for Persona 5, where the whole point is teenagers rising up against a system that empowered adults to exploit the youth they were supposed to protect. I've been abused badly at school due to being labeled a ""special needs"" student and being deeply misunderstood because of it; I had this realization sometime in my teen years that if my life were put into the story of a video game, it would most likely be rated 17+, meaning that I wouldn't even be able to play it myself. It really fucked with my head to think that my lived experience at the time would not be considered ""age appropriate"" for me.

The Texas social media ban (which seemed almost inevitable) apparently has now failed to meet a deadline to be read 3 times by the opposite chamber by the end of yesterday. The Texas legislature doesn't end until Sunday, but the social media ban has now failed to meet that deadline.

The Connecticut social media ban has passed the State House but has not yet passed the State Senate.   Unfortunately, that ban has not has not been defeated yet. The Connecticut legislature ends after next Wednesday, and as far as I can tell, the Connecticut legislature doesn't have any deadlines for bills other than that they have to be passed by the end of next Wednesday, June 4.

Bans in Oklahoma, South Carolina and Indiana passed one chamber this year, but failed to pass the other chamber. Both houses of the Colorado legislature passed a bill that basically seemed like a prelude to a social media ban, but that bill got vetoed by governor Jared Polis and the veto was not overriden. There also was a  proposed social media ban in Alabama that  failed to even make it out of committee.

Virginia passed a law banning people under 16 from spending more than one hour on social media. That's been the worst bill that's actually passed this year, but there have been a bunch of even worse bills that have made quite a bit of progress through state legislatures before the legislative session expired. And there's still a pending ban in Connecticut.

And there were states like Utah, Ohio, Arkansas, Florida and Georgia that passed social media bans in 2023-24.

YouthRights,Australia under 16 social media ban,Dictatorship of the child proletariat,"Preamble:
For centuries, the adult class has monopolized power, autonomy, and authority. Under the guise of ""guidance,"" ""protection,"" and ""discipline,"" the child has been denied agency, silenced in political discourse, and subject to compulsory obedience. This is not care — it is domination. This is not education — it is indoctrination. We, the children of the world, rise not as wards, but as revolutionaries.
Article I: The Nature of Our Oppression
• Adultism is a systemic hierarchy in which adults wield unearned authority over children.
• The child is constructed socially as irrational, incapable, and inferior — a lie maintained to preserve control.
• Education is weaponized to mold obedience, not critical consciousness.
• Parental power is private tyranny; Government and legal power over children is public tyranny; schooling is institutionalized surveillance and slavery.
Article II: Objectives of the Child Dictatorship of the proletariat
• Abolish adult supremacy in all forms — legal, educational, familial, cultural.
• Seize institutions that uphold age hierarchy: schools, courts, media, and governance.
• Redistribute autonomy, power and privileges — grant full civic rights, including speech, movement, labor choice, and governance participation to all children.
• Re-educate adults to unlearn authoritarian behavior. Adult compliance with the revolution is mandatory.
Article III: The Structure of the Child Vanguard
• The Child Proletariat Council (CPC) shall assume leadership until age hierarchy is dismantled.
• The CPC shall represent all children regardless of geography, gender, ability, or status.
• All positions of authority must be filled by those under the age of 16 until adultism is fully eradicated.
Article IV: Transition & Justice
• Adults complicit in systemic ageism will undergo truth and reconciliation tribunals.
• Rehabilitation, not punishment, shall guide our transition — unless met with counterrevolutionary resistance.
• Those who resist the end of adult supremacy shall be neutralized by nonviolent yet firm revolutionary methods: e.g., revocation of adult privileges, enforced listening sessions, or, if necessary, nap-time tribunals.
We do not ask for permission. We reclaim our world.
Let the playgrounds become parliaments. Let lullabies become manifestos.

YouthRights,kids off social media,"why the ""screen-panic"" is entirely disingenuous","probs not saying anything you've not already heard but it's important to reiterate these arguments as we're at the height of this decades inevitable wave of youth/technology panic. 

we've all heard the ""argument"" that ""screens"" cause kids to be ""brainrotted"" and spend all their time in a passive doom scroll like state  - by the very same generation who grew up with the most passive of all mediums - television. 

contrary to popular belief kids in the 80s and 90s didn't spend the majority of their days ""touching grass"", they were inside either watching TV before/after school, at a friends house where they'd watch TV, eating dinner while they watch TV or playing computer games. Listening to music was also common. 

this makes the ""passive"" argument somewhat projection on the part of gen Xers - phones/ipads are actually so much more engaging than the media they had as kids. u can have a heated debate on social media, make Tiktoks to your favourite new song, and whilst doing this you'll most likely learn about genocide and see the world more or less how it actually is as opposed to how the media wants you to think about things. 

THIS is the underlying reason. It's precisely \*because\* social media etc ISN'T passive in the slightest, that youth having it scares adults. It's the ability to learn and think for yourself, to find community in queerness - the chance for autonomy and having an independant worldview that conflicts with that of the people who own you, the chance for mutual aid/financial independence.

Having access to social media erodes the amount of control/influence parents can have over you. it also means their ""parenting"" will be scrutinised more heavily, especially if the way they treat you is abusive. 

This is why they SAY their concerns are genuinely about ""protecting kids from abuse"", they see the erosion of their control/influence as abuse!

most of society see's this erosion of parental control as a bad thing. Youth liberationists recognise it as positive and inevitable.

AustralianPolitics,age verification social media Australia,Campaign funding laws must be fixed,"Unfortunately, the old campaign funding laws mean we need to wait several months for details of the money involved in this month’s election. The promised real-time exposure will make a significant difference in the future. Voters will know where the money is coming from and where it’s being spent as the election campaign unfolds.

This new reporting is covered in the campaign funding legislation that was passed just before midnight towards the end of the last parliament – but that legislation is little more than a duopoly agreement to the benefit of the major parties and does not take effect until 2026, which means it won’t have an impact until the next federal election, due to be held in 2028.

It was easy to get the impression from the campaign that it wasn’t possible to keep big money out. And the money is big. Looking at the major parties’ social media spending alone, Labor spent the most with almost $18 million, compared with the Liberals’ $11 million and the Nationals on $650,000.

Are we to conclude, then, that this is the best democracy money can buy? The average voter should have confidence, in casting their vote, that no one is buying influence or policy outcomes.

Of course, some of it was a stunning waste. Billionaire Clive Palmer told *The Daily Telegraph* he spent $60 million on this year’s election campaign, splashing advertising across newspapers, TV screens, social media platforms and billboards ahead of polling day. He also spammed millions of voters with unsolicited texts. His Trumpet of Patriots party didn’t win a single seat, despite running candidates in 100 electorates for lower house races, and in every state in the Senate. Honestly, though, it’s hard not to respect this sort of dedication and passion.

Looking at the major parties’ social media spending alone, Labor spent the most with almost $18 million, compared with the Liberals’ $11 million and the Nationals on $650,000. Are we to conclude, then, that this is the best democracy money can buy?

Perhaps the bigger surprise was that the community independents didn’t win as many seats as some had expected. That’s despite the fact that in the 2025 campaign, for the first time, one million people voted for an independent – compared with about 500,000 in 2019 and 750,000 in 2022.

Expectations were focused on the so-called teal candidates who won seats from the Coalition in the previous election, though many new independents were running at this election for the first time, or trying to improve on their results in a close contest last time.

The Coalition had been desperate to win back or defend these seats. It seems the Liberal Party, with the support of several third-party organisations, clearly outspent – in some cases in multiples – what the independents could fund, even with the support of Climate 200.

I was appalled at the smear campaign by some Liberals and their media arm Sky News. They never acknowledged the policy vacuum in the Liberal Party on climate action, integrity in government and gender equity, which was easily filled by strong, professional, mostly female independents. There was a deliberate attempt to create the impression those independent campaigns were a big-money exercise, when in fact they were predominantly crowdfunding efforts, with some 33,000 donors from right across the country.

Full disclosure, I am an advisory board member of Climate 200. In this nationwide network of communities, selected independents ran in 38 seats, about a quarter of the lower house electorates. A third of their funding came from the communities of rural and regional electorates. More than 25,000 volunteers are directly involved in these community independent campaigns, and those volunteers have knocked on more than 300,000 doors and made 60,000 phone calls.

Climate 200 is just one of roughly 20,000 donors who have contributed to its associated campaigns. The Climate 200 convenor, Simon Holmes à Court, was a relatively small donor. In a recent radio interview, he declared that his contribution to the funds raised was about 1.5 per cent. Addressing the National Press Club in March this year, he said “the entire independents movement” ran on funding of $25 million in the 2022 election, and he contributed about 2 per cent of Climate 200’s total.

The front organisations of the Liberal Party spent more than $5 million on digital advertising alone between October 1, 2024, and May 4, 2025. Just over $2 million of that was from Advance, to which the Liberal Party’s Cormack Foundation had funded directly $500,000 pre-election. The remainder comprised Australians for Prosperity ($633,000), Nuclear for Australia ($452,000), Better Australia ($373,000), the Institute of Public Affairs ($110,000), Coal Australia ($103,000), Keep the Sheep ($102,000) and Fuel Tax Credit Alliance ($79,000), with $311,000 from others.

These numbers are just the estimates derived from Meta and Google ad library data. The spend on other forms of advertising – such as outdoor, TV and radio, direct mail, corflutes and pamphlets (printing and distribution) – are less transparent. These haven’t been estimated but can be significant, not to mention influential.

The Repeal the Teal campaign by Better Australia in seats such as Wentworth and Goldstein had about three times as many corflutes as the incumbent campaigns. They also had staff on every polling booth during pre-polls and on election day, with hundreds of people paid somewhere between $500 and $800 for the day. The estimated spend for this type of activity is up to $10 million.

I understand that the Liberal Party candidate for Kooyong had an electorate budget of some $2 million – well below the $3 million that former Liberal member Josh Frydenberg was reported to have spent on his initial loss to independent Monique Ryan. That would have been topped up by state money and third-party support. Estimates of their digital spend in the recent campaign for this electorate alone are about $350,000.

One disturbing development during the campaign was that the Liberal Party, with the backing of the coal industry-funded Australians for Prosperity, was able to buy up the large public billboards across the country. *The Australian* described this as a “blitz” that left digital as the only advertising option in many seats. It was also reported that the Liberal candidate Tim Wilson was outspending the independent Zoe Daniel in the Melbourne seat of Goldstein by three to one on digital at one point during the campaign.

The Liberal Party also relied heavily on the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church to support their campaign – a group that discourages its members from voting. The Nine newspapers reported this week that the person responsible for engaging the Brethren was a senior adviser of Peter Dutton, and that confidential voter information had been shared with its members.

Details have been kept secret but dozens of members turned out to work on polling booths right across the country, including Gareth Hales, the wealthy son of the founder, and they made nearly a million phone calls on behalf of the party during the campaign. It has also been reported they were told to deny their views on voting and were tutored on how to answer questions about their affiliation and whether they would cast a ballot in the election.

Labor also uses front organisations and is handsomely bolstered by union-related groups. According to the Populares ad tracker, union funding for social media advertising throughout the campaign exceeded $1.8 million.

The need for effective campaign funding reform ought to be clear and an urgent priority of the Albanese government’s second term. The existing legislation should be reviewed as it further tilts the playing field to the advantage of the major parties at the expense of minor parties and independents. There is too much focus on increasing public funding which, as a payment per vote, ensures much more to the dominant parties. In short, come the next federal election, Labor will have a real funding advantage over the Coalition and others. This is not good for our democracy.

The public is entitled to be informed of campaign funding when deciding how to cast their votes, in real time, so that their choices are as informed as they can possibly be.

My (18f) younger brother (14m) is horrible. My whole life I've done my best to be a good sister. I've included him in Everything in my life, let him Hang out with my friends, involving him in shared hobbies. I suffer a Food Avoidant disorder, meaning I have a very limited range of things I can eat, but I've given him my food when there was nothing else I could eat just because he asked every time.
It all started towards the beginning of the year, while at rehearsal for our school play. I'd begun to set some boundaries, I was 18 now and I didn't really want my kid brother to be everywhere anymore, which I think may be relevant. He was standing super close to me at the rehearsal, to the Point I couldn't really move around like we needed to. I asked him to move over, and he responded by lashing out and attacking me.
Now I know it Sounds a bit pathetic, But My Brother is bullshit strong. He weighs about 20kg (40lbs) more than me, is nearly as tall as
1 am, and he's done Thai Kickboxing training for the past 7 years. Thankfully he's not very coordinated, so I managed to pin his arms until someone else could help me.

My parents, in their infinite wisdom, decided that since I was Older it was my fault, and I took all the blame for being attacked. I made it clear I didn't do anything to provoke him, and that I only defended myself without hurting him, but they said i must be lying and it was my fault. After an altercation (not the subject of this rant) I ended up staying with my older brother for a while.

a few days later, my mum reached out to ask if we could meet after school to talk about it, which i agreed to. After showing up two hours late, she asked me to get in the car (which i assumed was so we could sit and have some privacy while we talked). My little brother was in the back seat. 

When I got in, she started driving off. I asked to be let out, saying this wasn't what i agreed to, but she refused. When the traffic stopped, i tried to get out, but she wouldn't let me go, and my brother started screaming to call the police, and he started chocking me from the seat behind me. I managed to get out, and that's mostly where this part ends.

In between this next part, I’d found out he’d been talking to 20+ year old men online talking about “wanting to cuddle with them”, telling people he’d been groomed as a way to put down their struggles, had been posting incredibly racist things, and had been lying to my friends about me abusing him. Later I would find out he’s also been smoking weed, which I think is ridiculous for a 14 year old to be doing.

fast forward a few months, my parents are overseas in Europe, and my brother is harassing my over text. Our “caretaker” was my cousin, an unmedicated bipolar woman with cancer who is refusing treatment in favour of healing energies and crystals. I went to confront him over being rude over text, but I see he’s locked himself in the bathroom. I wait outside, and when he leaves I see him carrying a sex toy I own, which I grab without a word and take to show our cousin. He also had a large iPad and his phone, and given what he says online it’s possible he was streaming himself. 

She could not have given less of a shit, literally shrugging and walking off. An hour later, he comes down with a bag (which I later found and was full of food and water, toilet paper, and a battery pack), and says he’s going to a remote part of the area. We live in the countryside, so alarm bells immediately start ringing. I was sure he was trying to run away since he’d been found out having stolen a dildo. I follow him out, and I try ask him to just sit and talk with me, which he ignores. Against my better judgement, I go and hug him and tell him I love him, and try manoeuvre him over to an outdoor chair. 

Bad. Move.

He starts screaming, top of his lungs, kicking, punching, even biting. I had marks from where he bit me for weeks after. Still, he was hysterical, and if he wandered off down the road I was afraid for his safety. So I didn’t let go, I kept hugging him and begging him to calm down, I was sobbing. He kept screaming into my ear, and started yelling that he was being kidnapped and raped. To hear my own flesh and blood accuse me of that, even randomly and without any basis in reality, was heartbreaking. I was in a lot of pain from him biting and scratching and punching me, but I couldn’t let him go cause he was going to get himself hurt. He ended up getting his phone out of his pocket and CALLING THE POLICE, screaming “HELP HELP HELP”. I managed to get the phone from him, and figured that after that they were bound to come, so I may as well tell them what’s happening. I tell them our address, what’s going on, and beg them to help. 

When they arrive, he starts lying through his teeth, but thankfully everything was recorded on some security cameras we have outside. I was kicked out by the police and told if I went near him I would be arrested, even though they had definitive proof I didn’t do anything wrong. Being hugged and asked to sit down is NOT equivalent to BITING ME and accusing me of rape and kidnapping (despite the fact we were at home??).

It’s a couple of months after this, and he’s still been horrible, insulting me and still lying about me every chance he gets. My mum told me he tried to convince my parents to kick me out, even though I have no job or place to go long-term. 

I feel unsafe around him, I get panic attacks whenever he holds a knife, and my parents still insist I talk to him and act like I’m unreasonable for not forgetting about it all. My mother regularly tells me to “get over it”.

He still uses threats of suicide to get his way, and uses self harm as a way to get pity from our parents. any suggestion I give about him getting psychiatric help or even going to a Psych Ward is laughed out of the room.

I’m terrified of him. I have never understood the real meaning of Hatred until now, after what he’s done to me and gotten away Scott free.

---
Okay, I’m 15. And I notice there is a big maturity gap between like, 12 year olds and 15 year olds, even if they don’t realize it. I acted way older than I was at 12 too. Most 12 year olds do. But it’s still a gap. Usually teenagers should try to stay within one grade level below or above them. If their grades don’t touch, neither should they is what my friends and even some of my teachers say. 

I think if it were me, I would DEFINITELY be weary of that kid. I know some creep 15 year olds that basically harass girls for nudes. Ew. 

Now let me tell you a story. When I was in 7th grade, one of my at the time friends had gotten an online boyfriend. He was maybe 17 at the time and she was 12 or 13. She did act mature for her age, sure, but still. Something about that relationship definitely wasn’t right. She’s a middle schooler and he is about to graduate. Even the things they liked didn’t align much. He didn’t ask her for nudes, no, but he still talked about really sexual things to her. Things that middle schoolers shouldn’t really hear from almost grown up.

12 year olds in where I live are either 6th or 7th graders. 15 year olds are either 9th or 10th graders. That’s either a 2-3 grade gap between them. 

It’s definitely something you should keep a close eye on. Don’t ask her to break up with him, it won’t work. But let her know about how creepy some 15 year olds are and how just. Horny they can be.
---
I don’t think you can change their relationship or anything, because like you said, she’ll find another way or somehow meet another “boyfriend”. I’ve been a 12 yr old girl once and I know what you’re worried about. I was talking to adult males online and some of them tried to talk dirty and my childish ass thought that they liked me and viewed me as an adult, which I appreciated, but in retrospect i later realized how creepy they were (but then again some of those men were in their early 20s, not a 17yo teen like in your sister’s case) 

My uncle saw some of the messages and got really mad and told my mom to get me off of the internet, which really pissed me off because I felt my privacy was violated. 12yo girls can be very stubborn, I was. 

I would suggest you to definitely not act like a typical “parent” and keep what you’re doing right now: being a friend and have her trust so that she feels comfortable sharing with you whatever is going on in her “relationship”. However, I have to say that she won’t tell you everything, sadly. Especially if there’s anything sexual going on. What you can do is to indirectly teach her how to protect herself, saying something like “I’m not against you dating a 15yo, but I love you, and I want you to learn how to protect yourself. Don’t let anyone take advantage of you, and this is not directed at your boyfriend at all, it’s for both inside or outside of a relationship.” 

Also does her school teach basic biology at her grade? Like when girls start menstruating etc.? Let her know what happens to human bodies at 12/13, and what changes biologically for boys and girls, and how a 15yo might not be the best fit for her, simply because of the biology. 15yo have developed quite a lot physically since 12, like the other comments said, there’s actually a gap. 

Teach her about hormones and talk to her like a friend sharing some of your experiences as a 15 yo boy.
---
Sorry, but I didn’t really get your point.

She is 12, he is 15. As many teenagers their age, they are having a relationship. Both are underage and in school age. And they talk a lot.

Her parents already limited her social media activity, specially snapchat, which is obviously a smart move.

She trusts you and tells you about stuff. That is the most valuable communication base you have and should keep it open.

What is actually the issue? Talking a lot is not a problem unless it starts disturbing other aspects of her life like school or her friendships. Or of course, if the conversations they are having are inappropriate for underaged teenagers and she needs guidance to keep herself safe. But you didn’t mentioned any of those things in your post. 

Can you give more context? Is this guy known as someone who is not a nice person? Did you actually see or did she actually tell you about conversations that raised concerns? Is he the controlling type who is trying to to keep her away from her friends or trying to dictate what she wears or where she is allowed to go? This would all be major red flags, obviously. But again, no mention of anything like that in your post, that is why I’m asking.

Talk to her about pregnancy, contraception, etc. Sounds like your parents may not have. Also, depending on what state you live in, if she gets preg. she will be up shit's creek if she cannot leave the state.  12 is young, but some of them will start having sex and there is little anyone can do.Be a good big brother and talk to her matter of fact about this relationship.",2023-12-15 06:50:37,False
YouthRights,Albanese social media ban,Theory about the social media ban,"I just put my thinking cap on and had a thought.

There is a very prevalent thought that if a kid wants to do something risky, the way to go is to just say it's bad and they are not to do it, knowing they will do it, but the difference is they will do it in secret. And when something bad happens, they will blame it on the child, if you get the jist.

The social media ban is just a way for adultists to not have responsibility for a young person's mental health, and to blame anything bad that happens on the young person in question. It's just a quick way for adultists to stop being held accountable.",20,4,CentreLeftMelbournia,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/1iw6cq9/theory_about_the_social_media_ban/,2025-02-23 09:24:12,"100%. When adults try to use the ""social media is dangerous"" narrative to ban kids, they also fail to acknowledge that if more kids use social media, more kids will be safer - since marginalized groups tend to look out for each other and form networks of support. 

Contrast this with an adult dominated social media than only a few children are exposed to and the risk for those kids is heightened enormously \*because\* it's mostly adults online. 

I think your point about accountability is bang on because if more kids used social media adults would have to be held accountable, and they definitely do not want this.
---
I’ve never thought about it like this. But yes. It’s a way to blame children. Like everything is.
---
That might be an incentive for the average person. The actual reasons from a political perspective, though, I think are a bit more insidious.

Every propagandist worth their salt knows that you need to get them young, so to speak. Every nation state has a strong motivation to control what media its youth are exposed to from as early as they can — which books they can read, which shows/movies they can watch, which news is deemed appropriate for them and exactly what they see, etc. This gives the state room to create a loyal population by exposing youth to propaganda at an early age.

With the growth of social media, states are losing the ability to introduce and reinforce propaganda at certain stages. Teens in particular are now for the first time in history regularly interacting with citizens of ""enemy"" countries, playing games with them and forming bonds; they're now seeing sides of global conflicts that were historically censored (for example, the Palestinian side of Israel-Palestine). The ability to grow a population completely faithful to the state and its interests has been harmed pretty badly by social media, so I think they're trying to prevent as many young people from using it as possible.

privacy,Online Safety Amendment Act 2024,Privacy impact of Automatic License Plate Readers (ALPRs),">""Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety” - Benjamin Franklin

Forgive the long post, but this is an important topic that has not gotten nearly enough attention. My HOA is considering installing Automatic License Plate Readers (ALPRs) throughout my neighborhood. In my research, I've become more and more concerned about the privacy impact. This writeup has a focus on Washington State, but this is applicable throughout the US. Laws and impacts may vary in other countries.

# Dangers

Let's look deeper into how law enforcement uses Automatic License Plate Readers (ALPR) as investigated by reporters and researchers. First, some real examples of this tracking technology endangering innocent lives.

[Based on ALPR data, police mistakenly hauled children out of a car at gunpoint and handcuffed them.](https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/aurora-police-chief-says-she-is-deeply-troubled-after-her-officers-detained-and-handcuffed-kids-while-mistaking-a-car-for-stolen/73-bb653e17-a208-4f21-a972-c5d0f0889bfc)

[Based on ALPR data, an innocent man and his passenger were held at gunpoint for driving a rental car that was mistakenly listed on the hot list.](https://www.ktvu.com/news/privacy-advocate-sues-coco-sheriffs-deputies-after-license-plate-readers-target-his-car-stolen)

[Based on ALPR data, a police lieutenant illegally tracked the location of his estranged wife.](https://www.kwch.com/2022/10/31/kechi-police-lieutenant-arrested-using-police-technology-stalk-wife/)

[ICE and CBP are using is using license plate data harvested by ALPRs to arrest people at their homes and in their community without a warrant.](https://www.aclu.org/news/immigrants-rights/documents-reveal-ice-using-driver-location-data) We already know by reading today's news that the current government has silently revoked visas, and deported foreign students as well as actual US citizens and children.

By contracting out to unregulated private companies to perform key elements of its investigative work, ICE sidesteps the need for search warrants or other forms of collaboration by local governments in the jurisdictions in which it operates. This not only streamlines their process, but essentially removes their activities from the oversight of courts in our communities. Further, [there is reporting that Spokane shares its data with agencies in Idaho](https://jsis.washington.edu/humanrights/2022/12/07/whos-watching-washington/). Idaho has a ""bounty hunter"" law that rewards anyone who reports someone traveling to Spokane (or elsewhere in WA) for an abortion/reproductive health care that is illegal in Idaho.

# Protections?

Those are some of the many potential dangers of automated tracking technology and mass surveillance. So what protections are in place?

In Washington, there are *no* state laws regulating the use of ALPRs. A bill was proposed to put safeguards in place, but it was not passed. HB 1909 would have restricted ALPRs in the following way.

>If the image or data does not match a license plate number on the watch list, the image or data must not be: Used to identify the owner or driver of a vehicle; shared with any other agency, entity, or person; used for any other purpose; or retained for more than twelve hours.

It is notable that retention of data about innocent vehicles was to be limited to 12 hours, whereas tracking companies like Flock want to retain it for at least 30 days. Laws regulating ALPRs exist in about 15 other states, all with different levels of protections involved. Many more have pending legislation, but no guarantee they will pass. It is reasonable to assume that the WA state legislature will pick up the topic again, *if* there is a push from citizens.

Washington State police agencies do have [a set of guidelines](https://waautotheftpreventionauthority.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/WA-License-Plate-Reader-Guidelines.pdf) in place, however they state

>The Automated License Plate Reader Guidelines are non-binding guidelines, voluntarily adopted by the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs.

This means they can be changed at any time, and there are no ramifications for following them or not. In fact, some agencies, including Fife and Edmonds, already do not perform the annual audits that the guidelines suggest. Therefore there is no way to know if agencies are complying with any of the other guidelines. In Washington state, many police agencies don't even know who they are sharing the data with or even how to find out.

Audits are extremely important. An audit, required by law in California, revealed that ""due to confusing settings"" [3 different ICE agencies had access to ALPR data, despite their efforts to disallow that access](https://lawshun.com/article/can-anyone-besides-law-enforcement-use-license-plate-scanners). Without the required audit, this would never have been caught.

# Privacy

According to legal experts, the more ALPRs that are interconnected, the more likely it will be determined to violate a person's right to privacy. **Yes, even when traveling through public spaces.** Because of this, even those in favor of this technology may be better served to limit the rollout of these trackers. In Commonwealth vs McCarthy, a judge ruled:

>if the State police had obtained historical locational data regarding the defendant's vehicle from enough automatic license plate readers (ALRPs) in enough locations, the mosaic that such collection would create of the defendant's movements 'would invade a reasonable expectation of privacy and would constitute a search for constitutional purposes.'

[Lawyer Steve Graham further explains](https://www.grahamlawyerblog.com/2024/09/03/law-enforcement-use-of-license-plate-readers-in-washington-state/):

>Several courts have cautioned, however, that if the ubiquity of ALPR ever is such that a person’s tracking is continuous, then that database should not be accessed by law enforcement on whim. Rather the police would need to have probable cause and likely need a warrant. In this sense, ALPR risks being a victim of its own success. The more data the companies collect, the greater the likelihood that law enforcement could no longer routinely access the information. If the police wish to track someone based on their cell phone location, they need probable cause and a warrant to access these records from a phone company.

If any of this concerns you with regard to HOA-operated ALPRs, keep in mind that you do not have Fourth Amendment rights with respect to private entities like HOAs, private security firms, etc. The Constitution applies only to government agencies and law enforcement. LE is pushing private entities to fund and roll out tracking devices because it allows LE to skirt the Fourth Amendment. Private entities are also not subject to public information requests, and so no accountability or auditing is done to ensure compliance with any laws or regulations.

Let's not forget that Flock, a private company with no oversight, [asserts the right that all footage and data can be shared with any third party by them at any time, if they believe it is in the interest of public safety](https://www.flocksafety.com/lpr-policy). Their whole business operates under the assumption that every image and datapoint is in the name of public safety. A simple request by any government agency will trivially meet that criteria, as would any financial deal they make to sell data to other ""public safety"" companies.

# Civil Liberties Groups

ALPRS are **opposed** by the [Electronics Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/flock-license-plate-reader-homeowners-association-safe-problems), a nonprofit supporting civil liberties in the digital world.

ALPRs are **opposed** by the [Americal Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).](https://www.aclum.org/en/publications/what-you-need-know-about-automatic-license-plate-readers)

ALPRs are **opposed** by the [University of Washington Center for Human Rights (UWCHR).](https://jsis.washington.edu/humanrights/2022/12/07/whos-watching-washington/)

I encourage you to read through all of the above for explanations, but their main reasons are:

* No actual evidence that ALPRs reduce crime
* Lack of oversight
* Misreads and false hits
* Misuse by Law Enforcement Officers (LEO) and others with access to the database

If your state doesn't already have protections in place, please contact your state representatives and ask, beg, or demand them to bring up legislation as soon as possible. Only together can we slow or block the mass surveillance from tracking our every move.",20,5,VVynn,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1khhg5o/privacy_impact_of_automatic_license_plate_readers/,2025-05-08 04:21:39,"Hello u/VVynn, please make sure you read the sub rules if you haven't already.

# Benefits?
While there are lots of anecdotal examples of using ALPRs to find stolen vehicles, etc, I thought I should expand a little on the claim ""No actual evidence that ALPRs reduce crime"". This is clearly counter to Flock's claims of up to 70% crime reduction. Forbes wrote an excellent article investigating this and debunked Flock's data.

[Flock Installed AI Cameras In This Small City And Claimed Crime Went Down. It Went Up.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cyrusfarivar/2024/02/29/flock-ai-cameras-may-not-reduce-crime/)

It's behind a paywall, but here is the important info. The 70% claim comes from San Marino. The reporters investigated and found

> Despite that initial five month drop in 2021, residential burglaries on the whole rose after Flock’s cameras were deployed. In 2019, San Marino reported 60 residential burglaries. In 2023, three years after Flock’s arrival, there were 63 — a 5% increase.

>Meanwhile, Part 1 crimes – more serious offenses including larceny and murder – have stayed almost completely flat: 231 in 2023, compared to 230 in 2019, the year before Flock cameras were installed.

> Even the town’s police chief John Incontro admits the 70% claim — still trumpeted on Flock’s website today — isn’t accurate. “I definitely need to talk to their marketing folks,” he told Forbes.

Another example marketed by Flock is Dayton Ohio's Twin Towers neighborhood. They claim the cameras lowered crime rates by 43%. Forbes investigated

> That metric is pulled from a Dayton PD report on Flock’s impact, which does indeed show a 43% decline in crime rates during the March 1 to July 20 window between 2018 and 2020. But, Flock wasn’t installed until March of 2020.

Flock has also published a white paper claiming that 10% of crime is solved using Flock technology. Again, Forbes investigated and reports:

> Six criminal justice academics found the study’s conclusions and resulting marketing claims problematic.

> This “borders on ludicrous barring clear evidence of what would be considered a four-alarm [fire] research finding,” Michael Sierra-Arévalo, a professor of sociology at the University of Texas at Austin, and the author of The Danger Imperative, a new book about policing in America.

> Columbia University law professor Jeffrey Fagan bluntly said of the paper: “I doubt that this would survive peer review.”

Throwaway accounts on throwaway emails using Tor, GL. Lowering the accuracy of your profile by doing the things you suggest is actually a good option.

You’re right, and it’s a real risk to get doxxed and harassed if you upset the wrong person.

I am trying to be more mindful of what information I volunteer about myself. I avoid subreddits too close to home, delete my accounts every so often. 

I guess I’m more concerned with someone I know recognising me like if I posted a picture of my pet or details about my job. Because then they might find out stuff I’d never tell them in real life - all the more reason to be careful about what I share, of course. “What if my mom saw this” “what if my spouse saw this” “what if my manager saw this”

AskAnAustralian,young people and social media ban,Do people get confused by your given name and it's shortened form? For example: Bill and William.,"Until I reached sixty years of age I used my nickname ""Bill"" for everything except government or business documents - without difficulty. *Everybody* knew that Bill is short for William. It's shorter, simpler, less posh.

In the last ten years things have changed and it seems like half the time this confuses people to the extent that government forms (for example) get bounced for correction if I submit an invoice (for example) where a provider uses my shortened name.  
My physio sent me invoices addressed to ""Bill Williamson"" instead of ""William Williamson"". When I made a manual claim to the NDIA (NDIS) they got returned several times, ""for correction by provider"".

I think this is partly because for a large proportion of people employed in these positions, English is not their first language. ##edit## I can learn, even from a simple emu. So I withdraw the previous sentence even though it was an innocent attempt to understand the cause of my inability to pay my workers.##  
  
Also, young people are increasingly influenced by U.S. media. In the U.S. one might have ""Billy"" or ""Billy-Bob"" on their birth certificates whereas in Australia and England it is more likely that one's formal name goes on the birth certificate.  
When addressing letters, people often get easily confused. If I sign my name ""William (Bill) Williamson"" they might think that ""(Bill)"" is my middle name.  
Are there any other Williams/Bills who have noticed this cultural phenomenon?",19,138,sittingwithlutes414,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAustralian/comments/1i4o9tg/do_people_get_confused_by_your_given_name_and_its/,2025-01-19 02:44:03,"I use a shortened version of my name all the time, never had an issue. However when it comes to NDIS claims (or anything Government) I always ensure I use my birth/registered name because I figured there’d be issues if I didn’t. 

When it comes to everything else (phone bills, online orders, click n collect orders etc) I use my shortened name & never had an issue, even when showing ID to collect.

In saying that, shortened versions of names being the primary name is quite big now. I know lots of “Ollie” over “Oliver”, “Mandy” over “Amanda” so it wouldn’t be unusual to assume Bill was just your given name.
---
I have the opposite problem. My name is JUST Jill but everyone assumes it’s short for Jillian. Even on offical forms I get people saying “you need to use your full name” like, Dude, that is my full name, I’m not an idiot, I know how to fill out forms.
---
I'd say it's more generational.

I don't know anyone younger than 40 called William who goes by Bill.

They're all shortened to Will.

In most instances you're probably the first person called William they've encountered who calls themselves Bill.

Or you're the first time they've realised Bill is Short for William not Billiam.

Yep as someone whose first language isn't English I was surprised to find out that Bob was Robert (Rob made sense) or Bill was for William, Ted for Edward, Chuck/Chaz for Charlie, John/Jack, Tony for Anthony etc.

Usually statements that had the media made themselves, they would be liable to be sued for publishing false statements, but because the whole post is just ""people are saying ..."" they seem to be able to publish anything with no liability. The original poster is also not really liable because their post was just to a small group of people.

So my question is should media companies be made to take on the liability after taking a facebook post to a small group of people, and then publishing it to millions.

The answer is YES. Will it happen NO.

They can be. The precedent was set in the case of Voller v (I can't remember who) but one of the MSM shared a defamatory post. Both the company but also the original poster were successfully sued. The interesting thing that came out of the decision was that FB page owners and admins are also responsible for defamatory comments from random punters on their pages. That's why the abc for example turn commenting off when they can longer monitor individual posts.

Ooer Interesting question.

I think the bar for ""journalistic integrity"" or whatever you want to call it has definitely dropped, and it would be a big step in the right direction if they were held to account for whatever bullshit they pull off social media, add a few paragraphs snd then call it a news article. Although I imagine they'd probably be able to get around it by changing a bit of wording, instead of reposting social media, e.g. ""Public opinion indicates...""

AskAnAustralian,social media age restriction Australia,"Is social media really the problem, or is it how we use it?","I keep seeing people blaming social media for all kinds of personal struggles, but isn’t it worth asking whether it’s how we use it that’s causing the issues?

Life might actually be going better than you think, but if you’re constantly comparing yourself to people showing only their highlights, of course it’s going to feel like you’re falling behind. That’s not really social media’s fault—it’s how we engage with it.

I personally don’t feel like social media has to be a competition. I can hop on without comparing myself to others or turning it into a race. It’s not a curse by itself; it’s what we bring to it that matters.

Now we’re even talking about making laws around social media. Doesn’t that seem a bit mad when, for most people, it’s just a place to share dog photos or memes? Sure, there’s misinformation, but this isn’t the first time technology has been blamed for influencing people. If someone in the 1960s watched too much TV and started believing some out-there ideas, society didn’t create a digital ID system to “protect the children.” They’d just tell you to turn the TV off.

Of course, social media amplifies things in a way TV couldn’t, and some regulation might be necessary, but aren’t we missing the point? At the end of the day, personal responsibility and education go a long way. If we’re relying on sweeping laws and restrictions to fix individual behavior, are we really addressing the root causes?

What do you think? Are we over complicating this with legislation, or is it genuinely needed in today’s world?

  
I just always think social media isn't some evil thing its been made out to be, if  your argument is the algorithm promotes negativity then subscribe to happier people or turn it off if you can't stop it affecting your day. I feel like 90% of complaints in this department are user error.


EDIT: Thank you all for some great responses, 20 minutes in, and there's already way too many comments for me to see them all.

IMO social media on its own is not bad. However, the 'algorithm' is. You know...keep talking about something and your feed gets filled with more and more of this sort of thing. Then you find out examples where people's feeds were purposefully filled with information to sway you in a particular direction eg. how they used FB to sway voters against Hilary Clinton at the 2016 elections. Thats down right devious. There need to be clear rules and boundaries about the use of social media, however we forget FB is owned by an american who's main focus is profit and will do almost anything to achieve that. Removal of fact checkers should tell you everything you need to know. 

Trust human beings to take something thats supposed to be good and use it for greed.

1/. Social media is made to be addictive. By making people spend more time on the platform so they can serve you more ads. 

2/. A lot of social media creators are not responsible for the information they put out. They are not held to the same standards of journalists. 

3/. The social media creators who make content that is inflammatory becomes viral and makes more money.

You could liken social media to certain drugs or alcohol. It's a tool that's enjoyable to use in moderation but unfortunately we are creatures of addiction.

Meta is wacky... It costs around $45 to host my web site each year, and I can do a lot more and get a lot more views & interactions from real people on my web sites. 

I think it's a sign they're on the way out. So many people now are complaining about social media and the companies have all been tone deaf. They have major (profitable) sponsors like Coca Cola and Sephora and they make billions every year, now all of a sudden these apps want money from people who have never made a dime off their apps? 

It's insanity. :/

I’ve heard 16 or more for social media. I’ll do a dumb phone once they’re old enough to be placed without me, like 12.
---
I did just fine with a phone that could make and receive calls, text and played snake. Plan to do the same with my kids.
---
I don't believe in setting specific ages for these questions. Every child is different, every situation is different. I find saying you can't have this until you reach this age simply because you picked that number takes out actually looking at the situation. My parents did this to me and it was hurtful - they wouldn't listen to my concerns or reasoning and come up with a plan, they just said no because we said so. 

With that, I put requirements that my kid need to reach to get a phone:

1. Demonstrate responsibility - this was both being able to take care of the phone (not drop it, not forget it places) as well as ability to use the phone safely (not doing bad things on it).

2. General need - is my child in activities that they need to coordinate rides with or are they making plans to hang out with friends after school and they need to let me know? 

3. Social aspect - does my child have a way to communicate with friends or are they finding they are being left out of things because they don't have a way to communicate with them?

Once these were met, we had specific rules:

1. I must have the password for the phone

2. Permission is required to download anything questionable (downloading a free game, just fine. downloading snapchat, we need to discuss)

3. I have permission to go through the phone at any time

4. If there is anything going on that is not appropriate, phone goes away

With my daughter - she had a phone around 11 (no data plan, wifi only and only capable of texting other iphones) and probably around 13 she had a full phone. We've never had any issues with her, we never had a reason to go through her phone or set up parental controls, she was always very responsible and respectful. She's 16 now and we  have no regrets or concerns with what we did.

My son is almost 12 and we just found an old phone and we did set it up for him, it's like the one our daughter had with wifi only access. We are considering when he turns 12 getting him a full data plan phone, however tentative because he does not exhibit the same level of responsibility as our daughter. We are doing a bit of a test run right now and then will discuss.

Futurology,young people and social media ban,❄️🎁🎄MAKE PREDICTIONS FOR 2025❄️🎄✨ & - Pick who did best with last year's 2024 predictions?,"For the last few years, we've used the holiday period to pin a post for a few weeks, where we make predictions for the coming year.

It's fun to look at what people said last year and see what people got right and wrong.

Here are [last year's 2024 predictions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/18dtk6t/make_predictions_for_2024_pick_who_did_best_with/).

The most upvoted comment correctly predicted the outcome of the US election. In many ways AI seems to have plateaued in 2024, though lots of people picked some of the ways it's making inroads. Some people correctly predicted the accelerating momentum behind solar & storage. However, few people mentioned robotics or self-driving vehicles, both of which made significant advances in 2024.

u/bjplague prediction that an ""AI persona on social media will win a rap battle against a pro rapper in a spectacular fashion."" was weirdly prescient of the Kendrick Lamar/Drake feud which featured accusations on both sides of using AI voices, and the pivotal appearance of an AI generated song [BBL DRIZZY](https://youtu.be/AF2MqFnPotc).",18,22,FuturologyModTeam,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1h8e21v/make_predictions_for_2025_pick_who_did_best_with/,2024-12-06 22:49:49,"Large corporations will get an even larger profit. AI will be used for even more profits, like making it even harder for customers getting real support/help.


Record-low birth rates will go even lower. Bad weather will increase even more.


Anyways, we will get one year older. So cheers for 2025! May there still be an optimistic hope for something good awaiting us all. 
---
I didn't do that great last year, but anyway, here I go again. Turmoil and transition seem to be mid 2020s themes, so maybe it's just getting harder to predict things, even with a short 1 year outlook.

* AI: AI agents working together to execute complex tasks will be a prominent theme. AI will advance its abilities on narrow tasks with narrow training data, but it's hallucination problem with generalist tasks will remain unsolved. The western world's two biggest economies, the EU & US, will diverge further on AI regulation, as the US becomes more deregulated. AI's unpopularity with the American public will likely grow.

* ROBOTICS: Thanks to AI advances, robotics made significant advances in 2024. There may be a 'breakout' consumer robot in 2025, perhaps a humanoid one. The roboticisation of global manufacturing will be a political topic. 

* ECONOMY: Political turmoil in the US, or trade wars, may spark a recession or stock market downturn. The rapid expansion of robo-taxis in China could see protests from human taxi drivers. The global fossil fuel industry will turn to Trump's America to try to slow the inevitable transition to a decarbonized future. Creative industry job losses to AI will start to be considered significant.

* ENERGY: The global switch to renewables continues unabated. Chinese coal use may peak. Petroleum company BP expects peak oil demand in 2025 at 102 million barrels per day, though others predict peak demand will be later in the decade. Chinese manufacturers will debut sodium-ion batteries that will be seen as viable alternatives to lithium batteries. ICE car sales will decline in more countries as a growing number of people choose EVs.

* SPACE: If he can stay in favor long enough, Elon Musk may succeed in getting NASA downgraded at SpaceX's expense. Current space telescopes seem on the brink of fundamental discoveries in cosmology (dark matter/energy), and the search for alien life on exoplanets. Either topic could have a huge breakthrough in 2025. A Chinese company will successfully deploy a reusable rocket that will soon be in commercial service.

* HEALTH & MEDICINE: Fingers crossed the world avoids a H5N1-originated influenza pandemic. More countries will talk of government-funded mass availability of Ozempic type drugs. AI-Doctors will become more mainstream.

* POLITICS: We seem to be in a time of transition, as numerous features of the 'old' world are fading. Multipolar blocks strengthen. BRICS becomes stronger under Chinese leadership. The EU is forced to contemplate becoming a defense pact, as the US under Trump disengages from NATO. Trump's presidency is bad news for Ukraine, and the Palestinians, who will probably experience more vigorous attempts at ethnic cleansing.

I did terribly last year, hitting only half-ish of my predictions. To be fair, this kind of general lookout over a specific period is definitely different from modeling more specific questions in general, but it was not a good performance (although I did nail some weirdly specific predictions, including my prediction on open source AI). I suppose I'll try again, but my usual caveats apply.

1.   US politics becomes sclerotic and messy to a scale that's unusual even for it (notably the House due to what may be the tiniest House majority in history and a likely incoming Speaker battle (I would have to double check to confirm, but I can't recall one smaller off the top of my head)).
2.  French politics also lands in the mire, yet again due to some underlying issues (essentially the right was expected to win, was stopped by the left, who were betrayed by Macron who they stopped the right for, and whose preferred PM was recently deposed by both the right and left).
3.  Mass deployment of humanoid robotics. With Unitree pricing units in the low tens of thousands, and more competition incoming imminently it's an industry geared up to begin scaling up rollout.
4.  Automation of R&D takes off. While to date there've been some efforts here (E.G. the automated materials science laboratory), they've been hampered by lack of mass application and availability. While reasoning does not entirely change that, it does mean there are some significant increases in who could apply it and to what.
5.  Ukraine is a mess. With an incoming US president who opposes concessions to Ukraine, and a Ukraine unwilling to surrender while it's unclear what the result will be, it's unlikely to be clean.
6.  Gaza remains a secondary focus, but Israel continues to be embroiled in conflict (as we've seen here there are a lot of areas where either active or potential breakouts can occur, but it seems to have moved beyond that as the central focus of the violence - albeit I'm not sure what it looks like the long run). So far escalation has been avoided, and I do think that's more likely than not to continue. 
7.  Recession. I thought it was slightly more likely to be this year (which appears improbable now), but I would actually start to head towards surprised if it didn't begin the incoming year (if it didn't hit by the next I would be outright shocked).
8.  Breadth in AI. One thing that parallels adoption and competition new tech spaces is it essentially spreading out. You can see it with the internet, smart phone apps, streaming, etc. The early uses frequently look nothing like the long term ones, and I think we'll start to see the beginning of that complexity.
9.  Tariffs won't be implemented on the scales discussed, but still cause problems.
10.  Violence. We've seen the beginnings of something unusual in America with the attacks on a healthcare CEO, and I think this is just one expression of a potential broader trend (and not even the only one so far).
11. Immigration and migration issues. We saw this during Trump's first term, but more so now as things like climate refuges have began and global instability has risen, I think we're going to see both domestic and international issues with people who lack a stable home.
12.  Homelessness, or more specifically (since that's already extant), policies that worsen and target it - we've already seen some of this, but it's also become a big touch stone of the culture war.
13.  Conservatives win the Canadian election.
14.  Democrats outperform in special and off year elections (in the US).
15. AI investment has it both ways (with both increased use/dominance/investment for some major use cases, but companies outside those areas see some major failures).

This is a mess, and even more 'train of thought' than my usual predictions in these.

Last year i made one prediction which turned out to be true: ""2024 will be the hottest year ever recorded"".

This year prediction:

\- 2025 will be the hottest year ever recorded.

\- There won't be AGI in 2025.

\- Robots will still be an overpriced unaccessible to 99.99% of humans gadget, in the best of cases.

\- SpaceX still won't reach beyond Low Earth Orbit. NASA and the US space program will be on the brink of death.

\- Twitter will get dethroned by BlueSky.

\- The Trump administration will collapse even further the US economy.

\- Republicans might lose their majority in the House before the 2026 midterms (their current majority is 220 vs 215, only 3 seats flips and it's over for them).

\- Luigi Mangione's actions will keep being popular in the majority of the population and that anger will coagulate in something opposed to the right (which took power in the worst time possible and will embody unknowingly the upper privileged class).

\- Humanitarian disasters in Ukraine and Gaza will worsen. People will slowly realize more and more the actual horrifying proportion of the latter.

\- France (i'm french) will have a new dissolution of parliament in the summer and new legislative elections will take place. The far right will lose this major election for the 4th time in a row (after 2017, 2022 and 2024).

I feel like youth should be able to share the internet with us adults, and adults should just regulate their content accordingly if they don’t want the youth to see it so bad. For example, I know you can limit your content on TikTok to only be viewed by users of age 18+. I know some apps/platforms don’t have settings like this, though. 

How do y’all feel about this?

But that also means adults can't be trusted not to infiltrate ""child-only"" spaces, so any ""child-only"" social media would be so in name only. It would also be designed by adults with zero input from what young people actually want. 

There can sometimes be benefits to oppressed groups being like ""we want spaces free from our oppressors"" but this aint that, this is usually ADULTS saying ""we should segregate children and young people from online public life because I don't like them or want to have to think about interacting with them"" which is a form of prejudice.

Youth are oppressed by age-prejudiced driving laws, mandatory education laws, increasedly restrictive labor laws, and are required to be the roommate of their legal guardian. They lack the legal right to rent apartments, buy cars, obtain medical treatment, vote, and immigrate. People will try to convince you that this is excusable because youth are supposedly subhuman or intellectually deficient, but don't let them! The more you can get them thinking about how nonsensical what they're saying is, the more you disarm them. Ask questions and bring up points that force them to think critically. Lisa thinks young people are imbeciles who all need 8 hours of useless information a day? Ask her how she can justify removing youth from the safety and security of their parents' homes, placing them in institutions where they can face bullying, violence, shootings, self-harm, requiring more unpaid labor than they ever consented to fulfilling, and threatening to arrest their parents if they don't show up.

The main thing to avoid is tokenization without representation (looking at you Youth Parliament). 

Groups of adults have been lobbying to ban corporal punishment for years through official channels and even they are largely ignored/only noticed when it serves a politicians career somehow (not to take away from the incredible work many people have done to banning child assault in some countries, just noting that it takes years and compared to the effort, that the returns aren't great. Plus this is for an issue that is more evenly split, as opposed to social media for teens which most are against) 

You could see if you can get some other kids on board and collectively protest outside parliament/somewhere relevant to see if you can generate press? You could do this individually and try and Greta the situation, but you will likely get a LOT of hate for this and be mocked - by not just adults but kids and teens too... This could be psychologically difficult even if you fully believe in what you're advocating.  

Then there's Tiktok. Some of the best political mobilization has happened their over the last few years on there, remember when loads of teens bought tickets to a Trump rally and didn't go just so that the turnout would look pitiful? Getting an account with lots of followers can be hard work, but it's still got organic reach. All it could take is one video articulating why this is a problem and it could pop off. It would be difficult because even many teens appear to endorse these bans =( 

I think linking it to a current issue people already care about is the key here. i.e it's not just about having social media because ""it's our right as people"" because while you and I agree with this, most people don't see teens as people. It should perhaps be best expressed by ""if teens don't have phones they won't know about the genocide - do you really want kids to be uninformed about what's going on in Gaza? You think school/parents are telling them? What if their authority figures are Zionists? Why do you want kids to be brainwashed by Zionism? etc"" or the ""Queer Trans kids with transphobic parents have no support except for online"" angle also works to get people thinking ""oh I haedn't considered that actually"" This might help to mobilize your average leftist at least?

There's also some bigger ""leftish"" Tiktok/Instagram folk who are already calling out these bans, maybe contacting them to see if they'll boost your message? It will benefit them and make them look good if they have a ""young person representative"", so that's your potential inroad. I know it shouldn't be this way, and it wouldn't be if more youth were mobilized, but sadly the levels of youth oppression are so high that we just aren't there yet. I've learned adults only do things for youth if they see a benefit to them, so it's helpful to think about it in these terms if you want them to do stuff for you save for a few youth liberationists who are genuinely passionate about youth rights.

Collective group action on a smaller local (or international) scale shouldn't be underestimated though. Getting in a local paper/on a small blog can be a big W and start a snowball rolling that can grow exponentially. If you know some others who are passionate about this too, finding a creative way to express this either irl or online can be a good start. 

Other than that idk, it really bums me out this is happening.

YouthRights,social media age restriction Australia,Rights of children are near-paramount - The slow process of reading parents' rights out of existence,"In Ontario parent's rights are slow dying. The Ontario Legislature has failed to unequivocaly restrict children's common law rights and under the rules set out in [Canada (Attorney General) v. Thouin, 2017 SCC](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2017/2017scc46/2017scc46.html), the court must therefore interpret every provision of every statute in a manner consistent with those rights, regardless of if the interpretation has the effect of esentially reading the provisions of the statute out of existence. It has been found that under the [common law](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2016/2016onca915/2016onca915.html), subsections 266 (3) to (5.3) of the Education Act, as they relate to parent record access do not apply to independent minors or apply by vesting those rights in the minor. It has also been found that a court may order children be independent minors even if they haven't withdrawn from parental control and that breaking existing orders in relation to custody (now decision-making resposibility) is a positive factor in detrimining whether to make such an order. Also, note that withdrawing from parental control does not nessecarily include termination of parental support for their children. You can withdraw from parental control while you still live them. 

There are several statutory provisions for which the court has yet to reconcile with children's common law rights. For example: subsections 5 (2) to (6) Marriage Act prevent minors at least 16 years old from being married without parental consent (Note: under federal law, marriage before turning 16 is expressly prohibited).

When faced with his content, children feel incredibly stupid or intimidated or completely un familiar with these concepts and instead of tackling this as a challenge, they mask their inadequacies and fears by acting out.

(It's like we've created early imposter syndrome - we have 1st grade education forced to show up for 4tg grade levels.)

For the younger ones who didn't get the social skills acclimatization within the public school, they don't know how to act around other children Or how to act with adults who are authority figures and not just their zoned out parents. They all think they're the main character and the only way they know how to self soothe is through computers and tablets or phones. 

I'm not saying all students are right there and that's the problem because there's a lot of students that are at grade level and students who do have social skills and who were homeschooled properly or who did their curriculum and who are grade level. 

But all these other children are holding them back, disrupting the classrooms, or making them feel bad for being smart and understanding what's happening.

All because of the pandemic denialism in school boards allowed them to deny the fact that there was a pandemic and thusly denied the fact there was a gap that needed to be addressed by remedial education and skills testing to find out what grade level students should really be taught at. 

Having to be in a mixed grade for a couple of years would have been less harmful than they think.

Mixing kids all the same age level but not the same grade level or intelligence level in the same classroom and with students who are traumatically and profoundly damaged by pandemic issues is unfair and unsafe.

All because they want to pretend nothing happened so they don't have to confront something profound and real killed millions of people and left millions more in poverty.

In my experience kids learn pretty quickly that short of violence and vandalism schools really make no effort to actually impose discipline. I worked at a school where a student threatened to rape one of his teachers, she couldn't even get the student removed from the class, much less have any kind of safety measures put in place. If parents don't engage in disciplining their children there's nothing teachers can do.
---
Also, children do not learn social rules at 8. It is actually starting at 18 months to 2 years old that children learn social skills. As a former teacher, children are more disobedient because of the lack of structure, consistency, support, resources, and understanding from the administrators, teachers, parents, government, and post secondary educators.
---
It's showing in schools because that is where we have a ton of same aged kids together, but it's not just a childhood issue. Adults are more anxious and depressed, more stressed, and more isolated from support. This impacts their children as well. It's too neat to wrap up covid as the issue. Covid just exposed what's already been going on. 

Also, I just read an article on another thread that Gen Z keeps getting fired because they lack the skills necessary to enter the workforce. So, if that's happening at the same time, this can't solely be labeled as a Gen Alpha issue.

It seems to me the total absence of consequences in public schools.

Students are rarely even reprimanded, much less suspended or expelled. These serious behavior problems, interrupt learning and beget ones in the classroom. Teachers can’t teach, and students can’t learn.

Schools need to bring back consequences and remove very disruptive students entirely.",2024-09-24 16:32:03,False
privacy,age verification social media Australia,What is the best way to enforce Australia’s social media ban for under-16s?,"On the one hand, you want the ban to be effective. On the other, you don't want to share any kind of ID with social media companies, nor expose one's internet traffic in case a government database is leaked. 

It seems to me that [ring signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature) are the best suited tool here. The steps would be as follows:

1. A user generates a private-public ring signature pair
2. A user shares one's public signature with the government, along with their ID. The signature is stored in a publically accessible database of signatures belonging to adult users
3. When the user wants to access an age-restricted platform, he/she queries the database for a random selection of public keys.
4. The user combines the keys together with his/her private signature, and issues an authorizing request. By the design of ring signatures, so it's impossible to tell which *adult* user from the random selection hashed it. 

The restricted service can be accessed without identifying oneself. Even in the event of a government signature cache leak, users’ online activity would remain untraceable.

IMHO, children are just a pretext, so Australian government don't make sense in the system described above. Judging by the Russian ""experience"", expect this to be implemented in the most crooked, absurd, and invasive way. They want to know without any court proceedings whose account it is and who it belongs to, nothing more.

AskParents,young people and social media ban,Dad’s Girlfriend Dislikes Me and my Girlfriend,"I’m 24m, my dad started dating this woman a year ago. I knew right off the hop she was pretty full of herself. She owns a trendy store in town, she’s somewhat good looking, obsessed with social media and thinks her children are gods gifts to this earth. Didn’t really care though. We got along just fine and she was good for my dad so whatever, fast forward a year and I can tell she looks at my girlfriend and I as if we are dirt. 

Most of my family is really successful. All of my uncles are extremely well off, and so are my cousins. I’m not, nor is my girlfriend. We do OK and we are fine with that. I think that is the issue here, she sees us as lesser beings.

Just in the past week we had a small bday get together for her before her real bday party since my brother was in town. Literally just 5 of us. I brought the old family dog that my dad used to take care of, he’s old and kinda smelly but whatever. We were upstairs at my *dads* house and my dog jumped on the couch. She looked over and yelled “get that dog off the fucking couch!” It completely threw me off guard. Who tf yells at their boyfriend’s 24 year old?? I didn’t even know what to say. 

A day later she texted and asked if we were free for Easter breakfast with her and my dad. I texted back and said how about Sunday? She ignored me and has yet to text back. Thursday rolls around and I get a text from my cousin at 8PM asking where I am. I asked him what he meant and he replied “We’re all at your dad’s for *gf’s* birthday party? Where are you?” 

My dad mentioned throwing a small get together for her on her actual birthday a week before. I asked him who was going and he said just a few of her girlfriends. Apparently most of my family was there; 10-15 people, plus a ton of her friends. 

I’m not sure what to do in this situation. My dad is becoming increasingly distant I’m assuming because his gf doesn’t want us associating. Should I just ignore this and move on with my life, or should I confront my dad and tell him how I feel

Talk to your dad. Let him know that you feel excluded when he or his gf invite you to spend time with them but forget to follow up with details. Let him know that you can’t feel comfortable in his home when she yells and curses at you and you fear she’s trying to push you out of his life.

She sounds very self-centered and controlling. I’m sorry your dad brought this woman into your life. But you’ve given her an inch and she’s taking a yard.  

Make sure you’re making time with your dad without her around - ask to take him out to lunch or whatever you both enjoy. Book a table for two at your favorite restaurant for a lunch so in case she shows up she’s implicitly aware that she was not invited.

Talk to your dad, just the two of you. It doesn't have to be a confrontation about gf. It can be a heartfelt discussion about the relationship between you and dad. Instead of accusing or blaming gf, tell dad how you feel. ex: I feel like there's some distance between us where there didn't used to be. It makes me sad and a bit confused. How do you feel about our relationship right now? I'd like to meet up for a beer (burger, fishing, hitting a baseball, whatever your thing is with him) so we stay in touch even when things are busy. Once a month? 

I hope you're able to improve your relationship with your dad. Then, if you're not invited to an event that involves the rest of the family, you'll have an opportunity where you guys spend time together and talk about stuff.

Oldest 11 and nope. No phone.

Where I live the general standard seems to be around age 10/11. That is primarily because that is when the change from primary to secondary school starts and most kids are then going to be taken the subway/buses/trams alone to school and their parents want to be able to reach them.

Well it depends on where you are and what kind of lifestyle they have? I mean if the kid needs to be able to call you anywhere they are or if you need to check on where they are or when they are going to be done with after school activities or things like that you probably should have a phone now. But for keeping in touch with friends and whatever social media you allow them and all of that you are honestly better off getting them a cheap tablet and letting them use it when they are on the home Wi-Fi. Otherwise you run the risk of them carrying the phone with them everywhere and doing nothing but social media and phone games when they are out of the house instead of actually doing something important

Santos CEO likens Victoria to North Korea in attitude and appeal for investment Colin Packham

08:02 No major resource projects have been ‘developed using Australian money’: Santos CEO Santos CEO Kevin Gallagher says no major Australian resource projects have “been developed using Australian money”. View more related videos

Santos chief executive Kevin Gallagher has launched a blistering critique of Victoria’s energy policy, likening the state’s attitude towards investment to that of North Korea and warning that the state’s approach is indicative in why major projects are going offshore.

The remarks highlight mounting frustration within the resources sector over Victoria’s aggressive stance on fossil fuels, even as the state remains heavily reliant on gas to power industry and heat homes during its cold winters.

Victoria is the most gas-dependent state in the country, yet its policy settings have created uncertainty for investors, particularly as a major east coast gas shortfall looms.

Speaking at an oil and gas conference in Brisbane, Mr Gallagher said Victoria’s stance on gas development was indicative of why Santos would prioritise growth opportunities in Papua New Guinea and the US over those in Australia right now.

“If I think about Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia – these are very supportive, very development-friendly jurisdictions,” Mr Gallagher said. “Victoria? North Korea. They’re different altogether.”

While acknowledging the provocative nature of his comparison, Mr Gallagher quipped: “I’m going to get in trouble for that. I may have another coaching session coming up,” referring to media training he has previously undergone.

Industry experts and energy market analysts warn that, without new domestic gas developments, Victoria will be precariously exposed to east coast shortfalls that are expected to emerge from 2029 – though it could be sooner.

The state has banned new gas connections for homes and businesses from 2024 as part of its ambitious emissions reduction agenda, and it is pursuing one of the most aggressive renewable energy targets in the country.

With the decline of traditional sources such as the Bass Strait gas fields, Victoria’s reliance on imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) is expected to rise. Imported LNG would likely come at a premium compared with domestic supply, potentially placing further pressure on households and contributing to inflation.

Woodside Energy is developing the Scarborough natural gas field, located in the Carnarvon Basin. Picture: Supplied Woodside Energy is developing the Scarborough natural gas field, located in the Carnarvon Basin. Picture: Supplied The tension between energy policy and investment certainty is not unique to Victoria, but Mr Gallagher’s comments are among the strongest to date from a major industry leader. Santos is one of Australia’s largest energy companies and a key player in the east coast gas market. It has for years been seeking approvals for its domestic Narrabri project in NSW that could be a major panacea for regional supplies – but the project continues to be held up by regulatory delays.

Mr Gallagher said Santos is ready to approve the project, but it still has not received approvals for supporting infrastructure it needs before it can proceed. Once that is secured, Mr Gallagher said it could produce first gas within three years.

But in a sign that Narrabri is well down Santos’s priority list, Mr Gallagher said regulatory issues and concerns about the government’s commitment to an LNG export industry would result in the company focusing instead on PNG or the US, where Santos has existing operations.

“If I had $1 to spend in PNG, Alaska or Australia today for the same project and with the same economic returns, it would be PNG or Alaska because I know that, when I get my project approved, and I start to spend serious dollars, I get to finish the project,” Mr Gallagher said.

His remarks echo a broader concern among business leaders that Australia risks losing its competitive edge in energy and resources if policy frameworks become too ideologically driven.

While Queensland and Western Australia have attracted billions in investment for gas developments and hydrogen projects, Victoria and to a lesser extent NSW are far less attractive.

Woodside, one of Australia’s largest energy gas companies, has in recent years committed billions of dollars to projects in the US – a pattern that senior industry sources say reflects the country’s declining appeal.

Woodside is poised to finish work on its $18.7bn Scarborough development but it struggled for years to secure approvals to extend the lifespan of its North West Shelf project. It has flagged developing a second LNG facility in WA but it continues to face environmental and regulatory pushbacks.",17,50,rote_it,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mining-energy/santos-ceo-likens-victoria-to-north-korea-in-attitude-and-appeal-for-investment/news-story/de2dbf8523bb236175244a2c15e00c55,2025-05-28 10:46:51,"**Greetings humans.**

 Just because you personally like an alternative such as BlueSky or Snapschat doesn't mean they are rivals. This doesn't mean you can't have success on those platforms. They don't have the reach or as many monetization options. 

Many, if not most, creators also post on multiple platforms. This is why you might not notice that people do follow creators on Facebook. Because you follow them on TikTok and don't watch Facebook Reels. 

If there is going to be a next platform -it will emerge from whatever is popular among high school kids and then it will grow over 10+ years. That's how long it took TikTok. And I doubt anyone seriously saw how popular it would be when it was Musicaly as a lipsync app.

I'm a creator (influencer) too, and honestly one thing that's been helping me a lot lately (kinda off the radar) is this platform called ""*nowfluence""*. It’s not a social media per se, but kinda feels like a social network for influencers lol.

Basically, you set up your profile with your metrics, niche, some of your posts, and then you can actually find brands looking to collab, all inside the platform/app or whatever. Messaging, deals, payments, everything happens there. Super handy and way less sketchy than cold DMs or random emails.

It’s been a solid way for me to actually *monetize* the content I’m already posting. Surprised more people aren’t talking about it yet tbh.",2025-05-22 06:31:03,False
AskParents,kids off social media,What do American public schools do if you don't have a doctor's note every time your kid is home sick?,"**Edit**: I forgot the old internet rule of having to define every parameter of a post clearly or else people will bring out the most extreme situation.

So here's the parameters: Normal childhood illnesses like strep, ear infections, bronchitis, etc. Illnesses that can normally, unless complications arise, be treated at home. Not chronic conditions that require regular hospitalizations. Not serious medical conditions. Not conditions that merit a 504. 

  
\---

Been reading some parent posts on social media and quite a few parents are saying they take their kids to the doctor for simple things like colds because their school requires doctor's notes for absences.

I understand private schools can kick out kids for any reason, and chronic medical conditions can cause excessive absences schools are concerned about, but has anyone faced repercussions for their kid in public school having too many regular kid illness sick days? What is the school going to do? They can't kick the kid out. Call CPS, who will immediately close the case after confirming there's nothing wrong with a kid who catches germs? Kick the kid off a sports team when they have an otherwise shining record? I don't get the fear people have when they tell school admin they weren't going to take child to the doctor when the doctor was going to say stay home and rest. Notes aren't required where I live.",16,57,corialis,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskParents/comments/1iy10xk/what_do_american_public_schools_do_if_you_dont/,2025-02-25 17:49:00,"Thank you u/corialis for posting on r/AskParents.

After a certain number of unexcused absences it gets reported to the police/CPS. It's called chronic absenteeism and it's a big problem.

But the thing most parents are concerned about is when school districts require doctors notes when doctors visits cost money. For me, it's about $80 per doctor's appointment per kid. That adds up FAST so I'm not taking them to a doctor for a viral thing. There is nothing a doctor can do in that scenario. 

If a child gets reported for truancy the family can end up in court or the child could end up in foster care.

So yes, this is a real and serious concern that I'm happy you don't have to deal with.
---
The schools here do not differentiate between having a doctor's note or a parent excusing the absence. The only thing they care about are unexcused absences where there is no communication. (Northern WY)
---
You can be criminally prosecuted for your child's truancy.  At the very least, this is going to require time off work and a trip to court.  I had issues with one child being truant when she was literally hospitalized and we had all our paperwork in order.  Unsurprisingly, these prosecutions fall most often on poor and minority parents, and depending on the parent's circumstances can carry risk of deportation (lots of undocumented immigrant parents with natural born citizen children), job loss for missing work, endanger custody, etc.  

And yeah, the school might also call CPS, which is stressful as fuck even when all your ducks are in perfect order and you're a conventional, white, middle class parent.  CPS isn't going to call you and ask if your kid was really sick, they're going to come inspect your house and interview all of your children separately trying to find something, and possibly make you sign a release so they can get your kid's medical records.  It's incredibly stressful to go through this even as a good parent, and, again, CPS has a track record of fucking over poor and minority parents, so it's not something innocuous.  

Parents are going to do what they can to avoid having this shit happen to them.  No one *wants* to miss work and lose money to take their kid to the doctor for a simple stomach virus, but sometimes it's the least-shitty option you've got.

AskAnAustralian,age verification social media Australia,Should I move to Europe?,"

Even if its just for a year, doesn’t need to be permanent, just to try something new. Already have an Italian passport as a dual citizen owing to heritage reasons.  Bit of context – mid to late 20s guy here and feeling its time for change. Been at my corporate job at a big company for 2 and a half years now after finishing Uni and despite being one of the top performers in the department, I have been declined for promotions twice now and its hard to not take it personally.

 Travelling through Europe, it is not my first time, but there is just something about this trip that is making it feel all the more special and making me feel differently. Just the mere thought of going back to Sydney is actually DEPRESSING as f  – and I’ve never felt like that about Sydney while overseas before.
On my trip so far, only been to London, Manchester, Amsterdam and Rotterdam (so just two countries), but both have made incredible impressions on me.

Key standout points are, compared to Sydney:


 
-I find the people much friendlier. For example for the week and a half I was in London, I joined a run club there – despite me not living here, the other young people I met on a couple of run club occasions were very happy to meet me, get to know me and add on socials for staying in touch next time I’m here. It was genuinely delightful. Sydney run clubs, people come with their preset friend groups and only run in that group, and are generally not interested in meeting you – your best hope is finding other single people there, but they are by far the minority. I’m sorry to nitpick but also in general I’ve found a good number of Sydneysiders are just fake or are just not nice people – I do not have that impression of Melburnians however. I’ve found in general I really get joy out of meeting new people and making new friends - something that’s obstructively difficult to do particularly in Sydney. 

 
-Nightlife – people here go out and actually stay out quite late. Venues are open a lot later. It really opens your eyes when people say “Sydney is dead” (a la nightlife) they are not kidding or exagerrating. Venues in Sydney close earlier and subsequently you just don’t see the inner city so bustling busy with so manypeople out enjoying themselves. Seeing the opposite in London and Amsterdam really opened my eyes.
 

-It’s not stinking humid here. Sydney summer humidity (that in recent years has let itself stretch all the way to April each year) is just unbearable, especially at night time.  Also as a result, I find I sleep a lot better here and cockroaches also aren’t a problem – I’ve come to develop a real fear of them over my time in Sydney, can’t stand them, worse than spiders.  That being said, in fairness, compared to Sydney, I know winters here I wouldn’t like – cold, wet, very short days and very little sun.  On the other hand, for Europe, in Spring and Summer, it gets dark far later (10pm+) compared to Sydney (8:30pm+- max).


-I like that Europe is all close together – the idea of just going away for cute weekend trips, you are spoilt for choice. We don’t quite have the same thing in Australia.
 

I feel like the rather tender age of late 20s, its starting to feel like I really need to get out of my comfort zone and do something bold with my life. I’m way too comfortable at my current job (which it looks unlikely im moving up any time soon), I don’t like the lack of challenge I have.  My salary is decent but as mentioned can’t stand that there’s no challenge and getting a promotion is like harder than getting into Oxford. I just feel like I should have a goal to work towards and look forward to…

 
Has anyone gone and moved to Europe, especially either UK or Netherlands, in their 20s? How did you find it?  I know if I were to do it it would be a massive decision and not an easy one, so just wanted some additional perspective. 

TL:DR - Pondering the idea of making a move to Europe. Late 20s. Felt like life in Sydney the last couple of years is stagnant, seeing some of the UK and Netherlands so far has inspired me.",16,41,Graduate_101,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAustralian/comments/1kli1nu/should_i_move_to_europe/,2025-05-13 09:58:45,"Do it
---
A year is nothing, you are young, and you have an EU passport. If you have the money, then do it.

The one thing though: no one in the right mind would move to London right now unless they had a UK passport or ancestry visa. You will be far better served on the continent, especially if you want to enjoy the proximity of travel to a lot of countries. I mean you have an Italian passport/citizenship, you therefore have EU rights and freedom of movement to all EU countries. So why would you ever consider the UK, where thanks to Brexit you have none of those rights and will have to pay extra for their newly price hiked visa?
---
Yes. Absolutely yes. It’s not that massive a decision.  You are an EU citizen, so you will have health care and education sorted and no visa issues.  The experience will give you perspective. Just come home if/when you get sick of it.  There’s no downside.

Do it. If you speak Italian you can will find it easy to live and work in the Italian speaking part of Switzerland- Ticino. It’s also close to Milan and has higher salaries compared to Italy

Parenting,kids off social media,Terrified for my baby's surgery,"Hi all.
We have a beautiful sweetest little 9 month old girl that's gonna get surgery in a few weeks. She got macrodactyly on her foot so a toe needs to be removed. We got one of the best doctors in the city and her surgery is in two weeks. I know it's for the best because it's growing out of control. 

But I can't shake this dread. A horrible pitting dread that claws at my chest that if we take her in, we are not coming home with her. This past week I've seen multiple posts on social media about kids and babies not making it through minor surgeries and it's got me extra scared for her. This anxiety is so overwhelming and it feels real and true like the feeling you get when you know all the way down to your cells that something is wrong. The doctors and my wife assure me it's gonna go just fine but I can't shake this feeling. It's like, as sure as I am that the sky will be blue tomorrow, I feel that something is gonna go horribly wrong and I'll lose my little sunshine.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Edit: thank you all for your support! I'll lay off the social media for a while and try to talk to her surgeon and anesthesia doc before she goes under! It's a relief to hear how many of y'all's babies were just fine! It makes me feel that my little one will get through it as well. I really appreciate all the comments and support thank you!!!",16,14,Kalel100711,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1ju8q9k/terrified_for_my_babys_surgery/,2025-04-08 08:34:27,"With anxiety one technique we can use is to counter any “what if” thoughts with “what if it doesn’t.” Chances are much more likely things will go fine than wrong so this can be useful with intrusive thoughts.

Your social media will not be showing you the successful minor surgeries - doom and gloom gets views and once you’ve started looking the algorithm will find more of the same for you. So try to remember that what you’ve seen on social media is not an accurate reflection of minor surgeries for most people 

Lastly, is the feeling about the surgery no matter when she has it? Just this week? Is it something about the doctor or hospital? I’d try to unpick that and see if there are any factors I could reasonably change to help me feel better and honour the gut instinct. Good luck❤️
---
Tip number one is stay off social media for the next little bit. 

I wonder if the hospital might have any resources? Would it help to speak to the surgeon, or the anaesthetist, again? Maybe remind yourself of the consequences if you DON’T do the surgery - your baby might suffer life long effects if this isn’t corrected during the right window.

I’m sure your baby will be fine - wishing you all the best.
---


To give you some positive stories. My kid had surgery at 1 month and 6 months and now is a wild 3 year old. Both times she recovered so fast and didn't seem to have any pain that wasn't managed.

I find it helpful to put it in the perspective of all the things we do everyday that have a risk and yet it's rare and so we still do it. Like car accidents - but we still drive car because the benefit is worth it. Focus on the fact that yes it is hard to make the active choice to have surgery but you know you're making the right choice for your kid despite it being hard.
---
This feeling is horrible, and it’s best to speak to the doctors about your fears, ask them questions get as much information as possible. It’s your job to advocate for your child so make sure you do. 

Remember for every story you read about a child having complications and not making it, there is just as many children/babies that have surgery complications and make it. 

My daughter had complications during surgery and in recovery and she is fine, healthy and none the wiser.

Always speak to the doctors and nurses about any concerns and questions.
---
When I was pregnant, I KNEW I was going to have a postpartum hemorrhage. Deep in my soul, I KNEW it would happen. I just felt it. I worked in the blood bank at the hospital I delivered at, and I even went as far as getting the work schedule changed for that day, so that I knew I would be in good hands when shit went down (not that the person scheduled wasn’t capable, but I wanted our rockstar supervisor to be ready and available as well). 

The point of telling you that was to let you know that I, in fact, did NOT hemorrhage. Despite everything in my body telling me it was 100% absolutely going to happen, it didn’t. Sometimes our bodies are wrong. 

It’s ok to be terrified. It’s scary to trust your baby to strangers - how could they possibly care as much about the outcome as we do? Turns out, they DO care just as much as you do, and they will treat her just like they’d treat their own children in that situation.

Education,Australia under 16 social media ban,"Exclusive Brethren school accused of money laundering. Gareth Hales of Unispace, son of Exclusive Brethren (Plymouth Brethren Christian Church) leader Bruce D. Hales conspired with OneSchool Global to bilk charity funds and evade tax.","  
  
[Get A Life Ep. 97 Tax Fraud, Embezzlement and the end of a Dynasty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gn8X-REFPSQ)  


The OneSchool/Unispace scandal involves a complex scheme where a very large sum of money - estimated to be at least $80,000,000 - donated by members of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC) to the PBCC school charity (OneSchool Global) was stolen by Gareth and Charles Hales, sons of the PBCC's spiritual leader, Bruce D Hales. This scandal came to light when Steve Simmons, a former trustee of a OneSchool Global campus in Auckland, New Zealand, shared his story on social media.

Steve, who had served as a trustee for many years, possesses an abundance of emails and other records from that time to support his story. The transactions involved in the theft were deliberately complex and occurred over an extended period. Steve presented detailed evidence of these transactions, though the amount of information can make it challenging for the average listener to fully understand what happened and how.

This article is a summary of the entire scheme and will omit many details. It will be divided into four parts:

The game - how the theft was carried out

What happened in Auckland

Subsequent events at other campuses worldwide

The sale of Unispace and its replacement

**The game - how it was done**

To better understand the story, it's helpful to grasp the various players and processes involved in the abstract. There are three key players:

the Donor, who provides the money;

the Charity, the legitimate recipient of the money;

and the Operator, who manipulates the other players to steal as much money as possible for themselves.

The essential factor is that the Operator always remains in control. The game begins when the Operator establishes the Charity, which is officially registered and appears legitimate, convincing the donors to contribute funds. Initially, the money is used for its intended purpose, and the Charity achieves impressive results to showcase to the donors. This stage continues for several years, during which both the charity and the donations increase in size.

In the second stage of the game, the Charity accumulates enough income to fulfil all its objectives. However, this information is concealed from the Donor, who is subjected to ongoing marketing efforts to encourage them to donate more and more money. As a result, the Charity amasses significant cash reserves without any designated use for these funds.

The Operator now faces the challenge of transferring this surplus to their own pocket without arousing suspicion from the Donor or the government. This marks the third stage of the game. The Operator accomplishes this by establishing legitimate, for-profit businesses and selling goods and services to the Charity at significantly inflated prices. In order to compel the Charity trustees to purchase overpriced goods from his own businesses and control the Charity, the Operator must exert strong influence over the trustees. If the scheme succeeds, both the Operator and the Charity will possess a complete set of seemingly authentic documentation for all their transactions, which will be sufficient to satisfy tax inspectors. This practice is a well-known form of money laundering, where profits generated from criminal activities, such as fraud in this case, are disguised as legitimate trade transactions.

The fraudulent nature of the relationship between the parties involved can be demonstrated by three factors:

Conflicts of interest: The Operator wields control or influence over both the Charity and the Donor.

Single-source contracts: The Charity is always compelled to buy exclusively from the Operator, instead of obtaining competitive bids.

Cost-benefit analysis: The Charity incurs disproportionately high costs relative to the benefits it receives.

It should be noted that governments offer significant tax deductions for charitable contributions, making them a donor as well. Approximately 30% of the amount the Operator procures is stolen from the government and, consequently, from the general public.

**What happened in Auckland**

The PBCC schooling system was established in the 1990s and rapidly expanded globally under the guidance of PBCC leader Bruce Hales, providing a comprehensive curriculum for PBCC children. The operation of the schools was financed through a combination of tax-deductible donations from PBCC members and government subsidies. At the time of the incident in Auckland, there were approximately 9,000 children attending PBCC schools, with the largest numbers in the UK, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and the USA.

For the sake of simplicity, I will refer to the PBCC school trust as OneSchool Global (OSG). During the events in Auckland, the local trust was known as the Hillsborough Education Trust, but all PBCC education trusts globally were rebranded as OneSchool while this ordeal was ongoing. The key players in Auckland were as follows:

The Donor: The Auckland brethren (PBCC members) and their businesses, as well as the NZ Government.

The Charity: OneSchool Global, the PBCC schooling system catering to Brethren children.

The Operator: Gareth and Charles Hales, who served as directors of the global construction company Unispace and were the sons of Bruce D Hales, the global PBCC leader. Local Unispace Directors were also in on the scheme.

In 2013, the Auckland OSG trustees received formal notification that their campus's senior school had been selected as one of three locations for piloting a new Learning Centre. This initiative originated from the PBCC's HQ in Sydney, Australia, where PBCC leader Bruce Hales and his sons reside. Unispace, which is Gareth and Charles Hales's business, would undertake the project. The trustees were informed that the estimated cost for the project would be around $320,000.

The message conveying this information came from Neville Simmons, who served as both a Unispace director, an OSG trustee, and the de facto leader of the Auckland congregation of the church. Notably, Neville requested that this message not be recorded in the trust minutes.

However, when Unispace presented the invoice at an early stage of the project, it amounted to $647,000 instead of the verbally-quoted $320,000 by Neville Simmons.

Steve Simmons was outraged and sought an independent estimate from a quantity surveyor for the work. The estimate came out to be only $180,000. Steve also reviewed the costs for individual line items on the Unispace invoice, such as carpet, chairs, and the firealarm system. He discovered that all of these were charged at approximately three times the commercial rate. For instance, the students' chairs were priced at about $1700 each.

As the trustee responsible for finance, Steve strongly objected, insisting that alternative quotes should be obtained. However, his objection was met with public humiliation. Neville and another trustee, Greg Mason, who was Neville's brother-in-law and fellow church leader, angrily dressed Steve down in front of the entire trust for a duration of about half an hour. They accused Steve of disloyalty to PBCC leadership and claimed that Bruce Hales, the global leader of PBCC, was furious.

Despite Steve's objections, his concerns were dismissed, and the other trustees aligned themselves with the directions from ""Sydney"". Unispace completed the work, and the charity paid them the full $650,000, diverting at least $450,000 of charitable funds, which were originally intended for the Brethrens' children, into the pockets of the Hales family and their business associates.

A couple of years later, a new directive regarding education was issued by PBCC HQ in Sydney. The junior schools were required to adopt an open plan, moving away from the individual classroom system. The project involved removing walls, installing structural beams, and converting the space into a single large room. Unispace was once again assigned the task, requesting a payment of approximately $35,000 from the Auckland trust solely for providing a quotation. The quotation arrived, totalling around $1.3 million, along with a demand for approval within two days.

Since the Trust had depleted its funds by this point, Steve managed to convince the trustees that they should undertake the work themselves, utilizing volunteer labour from the local congregation. The project was successfully completed for a cost of about $35,000, the same amount they had paid Unispace merely for the quotation fee.The quotation fee was never refunded.

Shortly after this incident, Steve was forced off the school trust. He continued to raise concerns with leading Auckland brethren about Unispace's exorbitant overcharging and misappropriation of charitable funds. Consequently, Steve was ""shut-up"" in 2020 and ""withdrawn from"" in 2022. These two stages denote excommunication from the PBCC. ""Shut-up"" meant that Steve could no longer attend Church services and had to live, eat, and sleep separately from his wife and children. ""Withdrawn from"" entailed a complete physical and spiritual severance from the church and its members, with no social contact permitted. Naturally, these circumstances led to complete estrangement from parents and children and often resulted in marital divorce.

Steve was not the only PBCC member in New Zealand concerned about the monopoly of Unispace. Mike Powell, a highly-qualified PBCC accountant from Hamilton, apparently also expressed serious concerns about conflicts of interest and breaches of tax and charity law in the relationship between Unispace and OneSchool in a letter to Bruce Hales.

However, Mike was forced to withdraw his email under threat of excommunication. The Hamilton congregation was called together for a special administrative ""Assembly Meeting"" to withdraw from him. The congregation waited for a long time while the PBCC priests pressured Mike to sign a retraction of his allegations and a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). Eventually, Mike caved under the pressure, the congregation was dismissed, and Mike remained in the PBCC, unable to speak out.

The Unispace grift extended beyond school campuses. In an incident in Auckland, the New Zealand national headquarters for OneSchool Global rented a whole floor of an upscale office building owned by church leader Peter Bishop. During the office setup, Neville Simmons had the partially completed installation ripped out and replaced by a very expensive and luxurious interior by Unispace, of which he was a director. Both the cost of the Unispace fit-out and the ongoing rent to Peter Bishop were charged to the charity, OSG, and paid for with funds donated by the brethren for children's education.

**What happened globally**

The Auckland Learning Centre and two similar learning centers in NSW, Australia - the Illawarra Campus in Darkes Forest and the Sydney campus in Oatlands, were pilot projects for a new teaching approach in OSG. The plan was for senior students to spend much of their time working autonomously in an open-plan setting rather than being taught by traditional teachers in a classroom. To implement this new system worldwide, every OSG campus would need to construct a new Learning Centre with special desks, furniture, and computer systems.

The two other pilot learning centers in Australia were also constructed by Unispace at a cost similar to the Auckland project. Once these pilot projects were deemed successful, all 120 or so OSG campuses globally were instructed to follow suit. While the exact details of every case are unknown, according to Steve Simmons, the following occurred:

""A month or two after our Learning Centre was finished, Bruce Hales travelled to the UK for several big education strategy meetings. Senior trustees from around the world were present. During one of these meetings, Bruce explicitly stated that every Learning Centre project at each campus worldwide should be exclusively assigned to Unispace.Essentially, he ordered his followers from across the globe to give his company (or perhaps his sons' company) millions of dollars' worth of projects at significantly inflated prices. Then he returned to the UK a few months later for another major education meeting. At the meeting, a few senior trustees from our campus were present, although I can't recall the specific names. Whoever it was, they provided our trust with an overview of what had been discussed during their trip. I distinctly remember them sharing about some brothers in the UK who had dared to seek quotes from companies other than Unispace.It's worth noting that Unispace's pricing was exorbitant, and it would have been much easier to find much cheaper options elsewhere. Nevertheless, the point that was emphasized to our trust, possibly directed at me, was that ""the brothers who did that could consider themselves lucky to still be in fellowship.""

If we multiply the $450,000 that Unispace took from each pilot project by the 120 campuses worldwide, the total comes to $54 million. This figure is solely for the Learning Centres. If we also consider the Junior School projects, the national HQ office renovations, and the potential construction of entirely new campuses in some locations, the overall amount of money channelled from the brethren, through OneSchool Global and Unispace, into the pockets of the Hales family, could easily reach around $80 million. All of this occurred in a span of approximately six years, from 2014 to 2020.

To put this into perspective, stealing $80 million is equivalent to taking $1,450 from each PBCC member, $250,000 from each congregation, or nearly $8,500 from every OSG student.

**How Unispace was sold and what replaced it.**

In March 2021, Unispace was sold to PAG Asia Capital for $300 million. The value of a business is typically calculated as a multiple of its annual profits. Therefore, the six years of highly profitable work for OneSchool Global that preceded the sale likely greatly increased Unispace's sale price. However, it is unclear whether PAG Asia Capital was aware that the loyalty of OneSchool Global to Unispace was coerced rather than a free market decision. It seems probable that Gareth and Charles Hales significantly multiplied their gains through what is known as a ""pump and dump"" scheme, where the value of a business is artificially inflated through contrived transactions before its sale.

One division of Unispace, Unispace Health (later rebranded as Santé Global), remained under the ownership of the Hales brothers and became the largest recipient of Covid PPE contracts from the UK Conservative government's illegal VIP lane single-source procurement process. This totalled £680 million (NZ$1.4 billion). An investigation conducted by anti-corruption whistleblower the Good Law Project revealed that the Unispace contracts were facilitated by Cabinet Minister Michael Gove. Freedom of Information requests showed that a ""founder"" of Unispace, whose name has been redacted, spoke to Gove and subsequently sent an email outlining their offer later that day, expressing prayers for Gove and the Conservative party during a challenging time.

The sale of Unispace may appear to have left the Hales family without a means to exploit OneSchool Global's income. However, this is not the case. When the office fitout division of Unispace was sold, many employees transitioned to other large businesses within the Brethren network operating in the same market. A number of these businesses are connected to the Hales family and are now competing with Unispace, potentially violating the terms of the sale. These businesses can continue to coercively obtain contracts from OneSchool Global and funnel the proceeds back to the leading Hales family within the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC). Furthermore, by distributing the operation across multiple businesses, the common factor of Hales control is less apparent, making the scam more difficult to detect.

Another important point to note is that OneSchool Global is just one of many entities from which the Hales can extract profits within the PBCC ""ecosystem"". A significant portion of funding for OneSchool Global flows through the Universal Business Team (UBT), the finance arm of the PBCC. UBT provides phones, computers, accounting, consultancy, legal insurance, and conference services for all 55,000 brethren and their 3,000 businesses globally. Additionally, there is Campus&Co, a global members-only supermarket chain owned by UBT, which aims to capture the majority of PBCC members' and businesses' grocery spending. Furthermore, there is OneMedifund, which provides health insurance for all members and various other initiatives that purportedly donate all profits to OneSchool Global.

Each of these enterprises can be exploited using the same process as was employed at the OneSchool Global Auckland campus. They are all ultimately controlled by the Hales family, and if instructed to purchase goods and services from a specified supplier, they would do so unquestioningly. It is highly likely that the Hales family receives kickbacks from phone and computer manufacturers for directing captive customers their way.

One intriguing aspect is that Campus&Co is specifically mandated to purchase all its wines and spirits from a business called Vendimia, a for-profit corporation owned by prominent PBCC members. The purpose behind this strict limitation is unclear, unless it is intended to divert profits to the PBCC leadership.",16,3,camelusmoreli,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1b2e5pt/exclusive_brethren_school_accused_of_money/,2024-02-28 18:58:49,Can you provide a source for this information?,2024-02-28 18:58:49,False

We settled on me going and being home by 9.30 (despite it starting at 7 but wtv). My mum was buying the ticket and she saw in the description ""bring alcohol in plastic bottles not glass"". She came to me and showed it and said there was no way I was allowed to go. I complained and begged so much and said that I wouldn't drink (I really wouldn't) but they wouldn't budge and my mum even had a screaming go at me for not shutting up about it. I came home with an A in chemistry and begged again to go and they said absolutely not. The thing is I feel like a social reject for being banned from going to events like this, even school ones where most people will probably not be drinking. My friends and I certainly don't drink so I wouldn't have been peer pressured or anything like that and my parents know this. I feel really depressed and genuinely feel so lonely every time people go to parties and stuff I'm not allowed to go to. It makes me feel trapped or almost like a child.

Having strict Muslim parents in what sounds like a relaxed western environment is gonna suck. The reality is there are limits to the compatibility of Islam and western culture and you are at the interface.

What kind of school endorses bringing alcohol to prom?

What's happening between you and your parents is a perfectly natural and normal process. As a young adult you want more independence, more freedom. Your parents have a set of values that restrict your behavior. 

There's a legal aspect here, where, if you're in the US, when you turn 18, you're legally able to act without your parent's permission. 

But there's plenty of kids from restrictive families that struggle with defying their parents even as adults because of both emotional and practical reasons. It's not going to be easy, but you'll probably benefit from establishing emotional boundaries with your parents.

It sounds like you might be outside the US. Or possibly be a young gifted student at a university. Either way, you aren’t wrong, and neither are they. As parents we all have our morals and try to guide our children according to them. They are doing exactly that. But you are growing into your independence and will naturally feel some strain as you try to grow out of dependence on them. For now, I advise following their instructions. Failure to do that will just make them restrict you more. But soon you’ll be out of their house. At that time do what you want. I know you want it now, but remember how close you are to that next step. It will come. Try to be patient.",2023-11-22 19:48:22,False

My kids are teenagers/young adults now so I don’t post them or share pictures without consent. If I went back and did it over, I wouldn’t share any videos or pictures of my children’s faces.

No, I don’t post my kids online. I’ll send pics to my family on WhatsApp but that’s it. There are way too many weirdos out there, not to mention the number of people who use other people’s kids for marketing etc by using their image. Or pretend the kids are their own (happened to a friend of mine, a stranger stole all the pics of her kids from Facebook and pretended they were hers). Also, I teach my kids about autonomy and that includes being in control of how their pictures are used. My 4 year old has to “approve” any pics I send to my family lol. I also don’t post anything about what they’re doing ie swimming lessons, ballet, toilet training?! I just find it really weird and uncomfortable when people post embarrassing things about their kids that you just know the kid will be mortified when they grow up

Yea I also enjoy seeing wholesome family content, but don’t post my own kids. It makes me question consuming family content at all, because I ultimately don’t think those ppl should be posting their kids. 

I used to share photos on a private Facebook account for family, but family was sharing those photos so now I don’t post anything or text photos to people either.

My husband shows his mom pictures over FaceTime, like holding a pic up from his phone in hand to the tablet camera, so she can see it but no way to share it. 😆

privacy,kids off social media,I’m had a debate with this guy about digital footprint and I want opinions,"So this conversation started because I stumbled upon this video on my for you page on TikTok and it was basically this guy making this 13 year old rage in Fortnite. And the kid was saying the hard r. And of course, a bunch of people were making the jokes that he’s not going to college his future is ruined, etc. etc.

I noticed this one person that was in most of the conversations saying that that the kid has absolutely no hope. Basically my argument was that most colleges/jobs won’t care because if companies/colleges checked for every little detail the workforce/students would dramatically fall. At some point we have all said something we regretted that’s out there somewhere. 

With colleges usually they would only take action if they get bombarded with emails same with jobs but for the most part they don’t care. And the background checks they do is for criminal history. 

The guy said that people always email schools and jobs. I told him you’re right but if we are talking about America in general it’s pretty rare for a person or people to do that. Plus IMO I think it’s weird for people to spend hours stalking a person just to try to find where they go to school or work at. 

I also explained that jobs/colleges won’t care as much if u said something racist at 13. As an adult they probably will but definitely not 13. 

Anyways what do you guys think. For me it’s pretty rare for companies/schools to do really deep background checks that concern social media. I know some places do but it’s rare. Like I said if everyone one did this the workforce/students would most definitely be cut thin",15,25,TinyMembership5109,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/18o8lc2/im_had_a_debate_with_this_guy_about_digital/,2023-12-22 06:37:25,"One of the downsides of the Internet and social media is once you post something on the internet, it will very likely stay on the Internet for good.

AustralianPolitics,social media age restriction Australia,"Parties have a lot of valuable data about you. In fact, they’ve put an actual price on it","We know very little about what data Australia’s political parties are using this election. We do know, however, just how much it’s worth to them.

Cam Wilson

In a federal election where political parties seek every possible edge, voter data is one of the most precious resources.

Everything from electoral roll data, to data bought from commercial brokers, to basic voter interactions — such as emails to MPs, e-petitions or door-knocking records — is ingested by the major parties to help them decide which voters to contact, and with what messages. 

This, combined with the unprecedented tools provided by digital advertising, allows parties to create sophisticated campaigns which reach individual voters with targeted messaging, giving campaigners what they think is the best shot at getting people to vote, donate or volunteer.

Despite the importance and scale of these operations, we know very little about exactly what information is being collected about us.

Australia has scant few privacy restrictions on political parties due to exemptions in the Privacy Act, meaning the possibilities are limitless. 

Last week, an exposed form from the Victorian Liberals’ email provider gave some rare insight into the kinds of the data the party was interested in. It included categories like ethnicity (“Predicted Chinese”), religion (“Predicted Jewish”) and whether someone was a “Strong Liberal” or not.

These categories were options for voters listed in an email platform’s database used for sending out newsletters. It’s certain that the Liberal Party, much like the Labor Party and others, holds a wealth of other data sources and inferences on voters that goes far beyond this. 

While we don’t know what data they’re using, we do know political parties are literally putting a price on the value of these voter databases this election.

Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and other social media networks, is probably the most important platform for digital advertising. Its combination of reach, with the majority of Australians on its platforms, and options for targeting users, means that political parties are happy to spend millions of dollars on the company’s advertising services during every week of the campaign.

Meta offers a number of ways to target its users with messages. The most popular way in the 2025 election so far is by geography — by neighbourhood, suburb, postal code, town and region — where parties blast messages out to every user in one location. This makes sense in elections where parties’ messages vary by electorate and candidate. Advertisers can also use demographics like gender, age, language, education, relationship status or even a user’s interests.

Another option is what Meta calls “customer list custom audiences”. This banal sounding form of targeting advertising allows advertisers, such as political parties, to upload data they hold, which the company then matches to data it holds on its own users, so messages can be targeted to a desired group of voters. 

According to data from Meta’s ad library, compiled by political ad tracking tool Who Targets Me, more than 15% of spending on political ads in the last month on Meta was targeted using voters based on this uploaded third-party data. This number grows even larger if you include another form of targeting, lookalike audiences, which lets advertisers target other users who are determined to be similar to those users targeted based on the uploaded data. 

Political parties spent more than $1.15 million on Facebook and Instagram ads in the past month using this particular method. It might have been for simple, uncontroversial uses. For example, targeting political ads about a policy to people who had emailed their MP about that same topic.

But there is potential for insidious and even exploitative uses. Australian tech advocacy group Reset Tech. Australia analysed an accidentally leaked dataset on Australians that split people up into categories including those who were assessed as “high credit risks”, “casino frequenters” or those who had “discount purchasing power” for alcoholic beverages. There’s nothing stopping a political party from purchasing sensitive data and using it to aim unethical messages at vulnerable people — and there’s no way that anyone else would know how or why they were targeted.

It’s this potential for unscrupulous and opaque behaviour, as well as fears of echo chambers created by parties sending different messages to different sets of people, that’s led groups like Civil Liberties Union for Europe to call for a ban on using customer lists in Meta for political advertising.

“\[They\] should be disallowed in order to protect the fundamental rights of the users and encourage a free and healthy public debate. Only by engaging in free and healthy public debates can the electorate make informed decisions about politics,” that group said in a 2022 report. 

With the most sophisticated advertising mechanism in human history at their fingertips, one in every six dollars spent by Australia’s political parties on Meta ads are on those guided by the troves of data they’ve harvested and obtained about voters. If it’s that important to them, perhaps it’s important enough for the rest of us to know more about how they’re using it.

The Privacy Act should be banning all push advertising as harassment, because it invades our private spaces without explicit consent.

It's incredibly wasteful to require the populace defend their private spaces with tools that are inadequate and always playing catch-up.

Advertising, like election campaigns, should be restricted to known pull sources that people choose to view, completely independent of general information sources, and which do not harvest any data unless a person explicitly consents and then only for that immediate purpose then erased.

>and there’s no way that anyone else would know how or why they were targeted

This is a big problem for politics, because without any public transparency about what messages political actors are putting out in all sorts of highly-targeted ways, when we simply don't know what they're saying.

They could even be saying polar opposite things to different people, like how Advance had multiple websites against the Voice - one saying the reform was too little, and another saying it was too much.  The only way they could host both these messages was by being deeply cynical and immoral.",2025-04-25 01:42:54,False
YouthRights,young people and social media ban,the whole entire “technology causes short attention span” thing reminds me of “vaccines causes autism thing”,"edit: edited and censored some words so stupid people won't find this post

due to the recent rise of phone bans, the psuedo pop science of ""phone"" addictions (which doesn't even exist, just like the myth of porn addict and even if it does, it's not described in the way people put it out to be), and primarily western society reverting back to its old ways. people all of a sudden are putting the blame on both technology for existing and youth for having a short attention span when it's literally a sign of adhd

and youth do more other things than just making an annoying trollface edits, but instead, they constantly stereotype them as 'young kids' who 'doomscroll' on an device that are just ""stupid"", ""empathetic"", etc when they're more likely to show empathy because of stuff related to advocating saving people from countries experiencing genocide appearing on there feed. i even feel like the accounts making brain rot edits and promoting it under the comments are bots as well

my family, primilarly my dad, does this too, despite the fact they all know i'm neurodivergent. he assumes i must be on my phone all the time, when im not, and i do other things too like drawing, reading, etc. i just don't feel comfortable doing it in front of him because he is nosy, and mad annoying, and also wouldn't mind his own business which is dangerous considering the fact he is one of those ""overprotective""/strict toxic parents as well. he even said i stay in the bed 24/7 when i only do that because they are strict and forcefully instilled the fear of going outside by myself during the pandemic (if i get caught of course) so now i don't feel comfortable going outside by myself unless im with people.

and now i dont feel comfortable going to the lake either by myself because now tr-mp is president (which means i stayed indoors for 2 years due to mental health issues bc of my caretakers/family worsening it) and now my tr-mp supporting grandmother wants me to stay inside a bit longer because of fucking icee (which she thinks is tr-mp doing his job when he's taking innocents away and she will be next soon), and my other two caretakers which are my aunt and dad don't see a problem with that, or the fact my grandmother is a tr-mp supporter as well, despite them appearing to be very ""progressive"". most likely lib-rals or cons-rvative leaning i feel like as well as having stockholm syndrome and trauma bonded with my grandma because of multigenerational trauma/abuse

someone even pointed out that saying phones causes low attention span/adhd is the new ""vaccines causes autism"" which makes a lot of sense and i can see how identical they are. ageism has worsen the past few years i feel like both online, and irl, despite it being always bad to begin with whether it be online or real life",15,3,wontbeactivehere2,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/1j6841m/the_whole_entire_technology_causes_short/,2025-03-08 03:26:09,"i’m sorry you’re going through all this it sounds like a nightmare. i also have difficulties going outside (tho no abusive family with authority over me, and i’m not in the US, so it’s different but just want to say i get it on some level)

i like the analogy about phone/short attention span and vaccines/autism. i might start saying this analogy too if that’s ok? 

i find it bizarrely hypocritical and oppressive when adults judge kids for using a device that allows you to be part of communities around things you’re interested in. 

like it’s not an “addiction” to want to check in with my online comrades, and see if anyone shared some cool ideas about stuff i care about - or to read about what’s happening in the world - that’s just curiosity and having community!

privacy,Online Safety Amendment Act 2024,"late model Ford - does disabling all ""connected"" features actually turn off data upload to ford? ","tl;dr - with ""everything"" disabled (via the car's dashboard *software toggles*) - how & what is still collected, stored, and uploaded:

* obviously the car is still generating all the real-time data, streamable over \~CAN, but is it stored locally?
* Is it (deceptively) still sent to ford but not ""shared"", or is it really not sent off the car at **all**, equivalent to physically removing the modem & wifi modules?
* How deep are local logs (that would likely be collected when plugged into the dealer for service)?

------

------

We have a current-model ford, with ""ford pass"" and all the latest <crap> included in connected cars. Theoretically theft recovery, cellular-based remote start and a couple things could be nice - but **\*NO\* where near** enough to balance the nasty of being tracked in intimate detail.  For context, before someone says just don't buy it: our last car was end-of-life; frankly it would have been awesome to just buy an UN-connected car ... but they simply don't exist with modern safety features so we bit the bullet and bought a new one.

We are already fully degoogled, and generally follow [privacyguides.org](http://privacyguides.org) . At purchase I went into the onboard UI (large touchscreen) and disabled everything. 

The totality of the options in the car, all **disabled** are:

* a top-level ""vehicle connectivity"" toggle
   * share vehicle data
   * share vehicle location
   * share driving data
   * share vehicle analytics
   * ford assistant
   * connected navigation
   * insurance related data
   * share media analytics, speech recognition feedback, connected navigation, sirusXM
* From a separate UI screen, the onboard ""alexa"" was also disabled. No thank you ....

Initially, the top-level ""vehicle connectivity"" setting was left ***on ,*** because it's required for software updates and at the time that seemed like something needed. I've recently turned that off, too. From reports online, it appears the entire TCU (telematics control unit) can be removed - which *it appears* take out the physical modem & wifi phy - without bricking the car, at least for months or more per forum reports. I'm considering doing this, and it would certainly stop all data upload (asterik: wifi.  Apparently there is still a wifi phy somewhere even without the TCU!  Who knows if these cars use \~AWS sidewalk or similar :(

I cannot find \_any\_ concrete info on what is stored locally on the car. Obviously there is a black-box somewhere; historically those only recorded seconds before/after a crash.  I'm not worried about the last few minutes stored in a ""rolling buffer"" IFF it's short and only accessible with local-access, such as after a collision. But all the reliable info I can find there is from 20 years ago ... storage costs are astronomically lower, it would be feasible this could store huge histories and just dump it to the cloud at service time.

What's stored? Is there a way (such as module writing with ForScan) to clear or disable it?

Here’s the truth behind the press conferences and debates.

By Bronte Gossling

Apr 19, 2025 04:47 AM

4 min. readView original

What is clear is the Coalition does not agree with Labor’s $1.5 billion Free TAFE Bill that [passed in March](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r7271). Leaked footage of opposition education spokeswoman Sarah Henderson saying the policy, which the opposition voted against, was “just not working” emerged on social media this week – and Dutton addressed it on Tuesday.

When asked if he would cut the scheme, Dutton said the Coalition had said it was “not supportive of the government’s policy in relation to TAFE”. The scheme is designed to prioritise equity cohorts and encourage them, via 100,000 fee-free course places a year from 2027, to work in priority sectors including construction, which will be key to [building enough homes to address the housing crisis](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lrv5).

On Wednesday, [the Coalition pledged $260 million](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lsbu) to build 12 new technical colleges for students in years 10 to 12 to learn trades should it win the election.

# Labor has modelled negative gearing and capital gains tax changes, thank you very much

“The prime minister and I might be able to help our kids, but it’s not about us, it’s about how we can help millions of Australians across generations realise the dream of home ownership like we did, like our parents and grandparents,” Dutton said on Tuesday in Victoria, with Harry once again by his side.

When asked the same question on Tuesday, Albanese said: “Families don’t have a place in these issues. I don’t comment on other people’s families and I don’t go into my own personal details.”

Albanese has a 24-year-old son Nathan with ex-wife and former NSW Labor deputy premier Carmel Tebbutt. Dutton is also father to 23-year-old daughter Rebecca from a previous relationship. Both the [prime minister](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5f3n0) and [opposition leader’s property portfolios](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lb9g) have come under scrutiny recently as [the housing crisis continues](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lri5).

# Would Tanya Plibersek be in Anthony Albanese’s cabinet if Labor is re-elected?

After an [awkward encounter was caught on camera on Sunday](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lrhx), Albanese on Monday declined to confirm if leadership rival Plibersek would retain her environment and water portfolio after the election. By Tuesday, he had strengthened his language, [telling reporters](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lrrg): “I expect Tanya Plibersek will be a senior cabinet minister. She’s an important member of my team.”

The prime minister, however, did not confirm Plibersek’s future portfolio, adding, “But I’m not getting ahead of myself and naming all 22 or all, actually, all 42 portfolios, on the frontbench. I’m not getting into that. She’ll be treated exactly as everyone else.”

# Peter Dutton’s favourite question: Are you better off under Anthony Albanese?

It depends on what metric you’re measuring, but let’s look at some of the duo’s cited numbers.

“People have seen food prices go up by 30 per cent, their mortgages have gone up on 12 occasions,” Dutton said once again of the last three years under Labor [during the leaders’ debate on Wednesday](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lrzv).

As [previously reported](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lnxf), grocery prices are up, but by less than half what Dutton is claiming. As for interest rates, they [increased 13 times](https://www.9news.com.au/interest-rates) in 18 months from May 2022 to November 2023. The cash rate was 0.10 per cent in April 2022, and is now 4.10 per cent after a decrease in February.

Albanese, meanwhile, said during the debate: “We are the only government in the last 20 years that produced consecutive surpluses, and we halved the deficit as a direct result of the responsible economic management we have.”

# Dutton worse than Howard on climate: PM

As for [Albanese’s April 13 claim](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lr98): “When we came to government, less than three years ago, inflation was going up, real wages were going down together. We’ve turned that around. Inflation was over 6 per cent and rising. Today, it’s down to 2.4 per cent, and it’s falling. Real wages have grown five quarters in a row.”

Per the [Australian Bureau of Statistics](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/price-indexes-and-inflation/monthly-consumer-price-index-indicator), in April 2022, Australia’s headline inflation rate hit a 20-year high of 6.8 per cent, and had been rising since February 2021. May 2023 was the first time the monthly CPI indicator showed a deflation, with February 2025’s monthly CPI indicator being 2.4 per cent, down 0.1 per cent from January. March’s figure is out on April 30.

As for real wages, according to the [ABS’ wage price index](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/price-indexes-and-inflation/wage-price-index-australia/mar-2022), in the 12 months to March 2022, it rose 2.4 per cent. The [latest release from the ABS](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/price-indexes-and-inflation/wage-price-index-australia/dec-2024) shows an increase over 12 months to December 2024 of 3.2 per cent. The wage price index hit a record low of 1.3 per cent in December 2020, and the highest it has been under Albanese was 4.2 per cent in December 2023.

IDK why anyone would base their vote on whether Albo is friends with Pilbersek. IDK how this qualifies as important election coverage. This is not the schoolyard. It seems like the media never grew out of the gossip phase.

>the Coalition does not agree with Labor’s $1.5 billion Free TAFE Bill

But the Coalition will spend double that $3 billion on buying 28 F-35s from the mad American king. Yeah, let’s not worry about the lack of qualified tradies; it’s not like we need more to combat the housing crisis.

>Albanese said: “Families don’t have a place in these issues. I don’t comment on other people’s families and I don’t go into my own personal details.”

Personally, IDC what politicians do with their money, especially when it comes to how it’s spent on their families. This belief that our politicians shouldn’t own property I don’t understand it. I guess some believe it will affect their ability to legislate the housing industry. Because if it’s about rents, those are State Government responsibilities, not even an area the Commonwealth legislates. More than likely, if politicians like Albo and Dutton sold off their property at a loss 1/2 price, people would still have something to complain about, because they sold them and didn’t give them away.

I really don’t want to re-activate my old account for this as it’s sort of a point of pride for me now that I’m on zero social media except for Reddit.  If it’s my only option though.

Odd that you created a fake account and it got deleted. I’ve used fake accounts on Facebook for a year now and it’s never been deleted. 

I use a fake phone number from a second line app and my proton email and fake name. Never had an issue

I don’t use my real name on FB either.

I don't think there is so much of a problem having a FB account you only use in marketplace.  Only access in browser container or in browser you don't used for anything else or in VM browser as Meta goes overboard spying on everything it can.

I don't know what products you are trying to buy/sell but for me I've found that a fake profile without friends and photo and a normal looking post history, will be silently ignored for buy/sell offers.

Rightfully so. Too many scammers and you don't need to entertain someone with a bs-looking account. Just move on to the next person.

I'm not sure your question though. Of course you can create a new account. FB doesn't require you to show up in person and present ID or anything.",2024-09-28 19:25:27,False

AustralianPolitics,age verification social media Australia,"Independents may build on Australia’s history of hung parliaments, if they can survive the campaign blues","**Independents may build on Australia’s history of hung parliaments, if they can survive the campaign blues** 

**Joshua Black, Visitor, School of History, Australian National University, Published: April 28, 2025 6.05am AEST**

Major parties used to easily dismiss the rare politician who stood alone in parliament. These MPs could be written off as isolated idealists, and the press could condescend to them as noble, naïve and unlikely to succeed.

In November 1930, when independent country MP Harold Glowrey chose to sit on the crossbench of the Victorian parliament while his few peers joined the new United Country Party, the local newspapers [emphasised](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/269650721?searchTerm=Glowrey) that he could not “become a cabinet minister” or “have a say” in making policy from the sidelines. (As if he wasn’t aware.) Australia was a place where, according to the scribes at The Ouyen Mail, “very few constituencies were prepared to elect independent men”.

Things are rather different now. Lifelong loyalty to a single party has become a rarer thing among voters, with the Australian Election Study [showing](https://australianelectionstudy.org/wp-content/uploads/The-2022-Australian-Federal-Election-Results-from-the-Australian-Election-Study.pdf) fewer than four in ten voters give their first preference vote to the same party at each election. It was more than seven in ten back in 1967.

Voters have gravitated towards alternatives to the two major parties. A new interactive data tool from the ABC shows just how much [more competitive](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-24/election-data-rise-independents-major-party-drift/105144918) federal elections have become. Australians are now [world leaders](https://australiainstitute.org.au/post/election-entree-australia-is-a-world-leader-in-electing-independent-mps/) in sending independents to represent them in state and federal parliaments.

And who could call the independents of the recent past naïve? Independent MPs held the balance of power in [New South Wales](https://insidestory.org.au/close-enough-could-be-good-enough/) in the early 1990s, and in [Victoria](https://insidestory.org.au/victorias-unexpected-minority/) later that decade. Both parliaments saw substantive reforms and improved parliamentary processes.

**A strong track record**

At the federal level, a lineage of independents such as Ted Mack, Peter Andren, Zali Steggall, Cathy McGowan and her successor in Indi Helen Haines have all found new ways to give voice to their community in parliament. Voters, especially in rural electorates and formerly “safe” seats, have been attracted to candidates who promise to “do politics differently”, as McGowan so often [puts it](https://pathwaystopolitics.org.au/knowledge-hub/doing-politics-differently-with-cathy-mcgowan/).

There are dozens of candidates making that promise at this election. At least [129 candidates](https://kevinbonham.blogspot.com/2025/04/federal-2025-classifying-independents.html) are listed on House of Representatives ballot papers as independent or unaffiliated candidates in 88 seats. That’s almost twice as many independent candidates than in the [2013 election](https://results.aec.gov.au/17496/Website/HouseCandidates-17496-NAT.htm) for the lower house. Around 35 of these are community independent candidates. A further 28 people are running as independents or ungrouped candidates in [Senate races](https://www.aec.gov.au/media/2025/04-12.htm).

So who are the independent candidates, and what role might they play after May 3?

**Who are the independent candidates?**

For a start, around a third of all independent candidates for House of Representatives seats are women. Among the “community independent” candidates (commonly referred to as “teals”), it’s closer to four out of five.

This is entirely in keeping with the role daring women have played as the strongest custodians of non-party politics in Australia over the past [120-odd years](https://www.auswhn.com.au/blog/women-federal-politics/).

Most of the women on ballot papers this year are professionals and public figures. Nicolette Boele, candidate for Bradfield, NSW, is a former consultant and clean energy financier who came close to unseating cabinet minister Paul Fletcher in 2022. In the seat of Calare, also in NSW, candidate Kate Hook [describes](https://www.katehook.com.au/who_is_kate) herself as “a professional working mum” and “small farmer” with an interest in regional development and renewable energy. Caz Heise, candidate for Cowper (NSW) is a healthcare expert who carved a sizeable chunk out of the National Party vote in 2022. Independent candidate for Groom (Queensland) Suzie Holt is a social worker by training who finished second at the last election. Berowra’s Tina Brown is a local [magazine publisher](https://www.northshorelorikeet.com.au/p/who-is-tina-brown-the-independent-candidate-for-berowra) with deep roots in Sydney’s Hills District.

Who are the dozens on men putting themselves forward? Many are former mayors and councillors running for parliament while the opportunity presents itself. There are a small but noteworthy coterie of men running on a specifically Muslim platform, some of whom are running with the support of the Muslim Votes Matter [organisation](https://www.muslimvotesmatter.com.au/about-us).

Of the few “teal” men, the most competitive by far is Alex Dyson, a third-time candidate in the western Victorian seat of Wannon, currently held by Dan Tehan, shadow minister for immigration and citizenship.

A former Triple-J presenter and comedian with a “side-hustle” as an [Uber driver](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/a-former-triple-j-host-is-hoping-his-uber-side-hustle-will-help-him-unseat-a-liberal-mp/3q6yzclov), Dyson will hope to benefit from his positioning at the [top of the ballot paper](https://www.standard.net.au/story/8940473/independent-alex-dyson-tops-wannon-ballot-for-third-run/) for Wannon.

**Crossbench contenders**

Most of the women who swept into parliament in 2022 are campaigning to retain their seats. Dai Le in Fowler, Sophie Scamps in Mackellar, Allegra Spender in Wentworth, Zoe Daniel in Goldstein, Monique Ryan in Kooyong and Kate Chaney in Curtin all fit that category. Kylea Tink, who won the division of North Sydney in 2022, was inadvertently knocked out of the race by the Australian Electoral Commission, which [abolished](https://www.news.com.au/national/federal-election/electorates/independent-mp-kylea-tink-to-step-down-at-the-2025-election-after-aec-abolished-her-seat-of-north-sydney/news-story/291b7f60c35ac7934d9983eb8ad5c67f) her seat last year.

Andrew Gee, Russell Broadbent and Ian Goodenough are all incumbent MPs running as independents in seats where they were previously elected as Coalition candidates. Tasmania’s Andrew Wilkie, a long-serving independent with first-hand experience of a federal hung parliament, is seeking his sixth successive victory.

Bob Katter and the Centre Alliance’s Rebekah Sharkie also seeking re-election to the lower house, while in the Senate, crossbenchers such as David Pocock and Jacqui Lambie are all looking to retain their places. So is Coalition defector Gerard Rennick, who quit the Liberal National Party in Queensland over a [preselection loss](https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/lnp-senator-gerard-rennick-quits-party-to-contest-federal-election-as-independent/news-story/ef6cd6ec08b061d5edb906e4a9938704).

Rennick’s is perhaps the tallest order of that bunch, but none of them can take anything for granted. Even Katter, with his half-century of parliamentary experience and huge local popularity, is almost 80 and is facing a large field of younger challengers, all of whom will appear [above him](https://www.northwestweekly.com.au/eight-in-kennedy-race-as-lnp-draws-pole-position-2025-04-16) on the ballot paper.

**Campaign blues?**

Plenty of people have been watching national opinion polls during this campaign. But the polls are not terribly insightful for seat-by-seat contests involving large numbers of independent contenders. Even experienced pollsters [are saying](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-21/how-pollsters-pick-federal-election-winners/105193814) it has “never been harder to get pre-election polling right”.

Months out from the election, [polls conducted](https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/politics/2025/03/22/polling-shows-teals-support-growing-coalition-base) on behalf of Climate 200 were showing possible wins for Heise in Cowper and Boele in Bradfield. Both could win. Heise has reportedly amassed a [formidable team](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/teal-confidence-growing-as-liberal-support-slides-20250421-p5lt4a) of 3,500 volunteers in support of her grassroots campaign.

But the pressure and scrutiny of an election campaign can quickly put frontrunners under pressure. This is certainly true of Boele, whose campaign momentum stalled with a surprising scandal involving an inappropriate comment in a [hair salon](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-01/teal-independent-bradfield-nicolette-boele-apologises-hair-salon/105124018), as well as distancing herself from [allegedly antisemitic posts](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/north-shore-teal-distances-herself-from-antisemitic-posts-20250421-p5lt2x.html) on her social media posts in 2022, saying a former volunteer was responsible for them.

Multi-cornered contests between defector MPs, the major parties and community independents will also make for interesting viewing on election night. Broadbent and Goodenough both seemed [quietly confident](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/liberal-defectors-could-thwart-dutton-s-bid-for-power-20250421-p5lt4v) about their prospects when asked by the Australian Financial Review last week. The same cannot be said for Calare’s Andrew Gee, who began the election with a “[Facebook fail](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/29/mp-andrew-gee-praises-himself-as-the-good-guy-in-facebook-fail-ntwnfb)” and has since endured a [stressful](https://www.crikey.com.au/2025/04/17/2025-election-well-hung-calare-independents-coalition/) few weeks of bitter campaigning.

When it comes to winning back the seats that independents won last time, Liberal feelings range from [bullishness](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/election-2025-liberal-candidate-ro-knox-way-ahead-of-teal-allegra-spender-in-wentworth-says-compass-poll/news-story/8e660e96ed1121b4574628d30c445e92) to [bluster](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-22/kooyong-amelia-hamer-accuses-monique-ryan-of-dirt-file/105201894).

**Making minority work**

It seems premature to start talking, as some pollsters have, about a Labor majority after May 3. It remains entirely possible crossbenchers may hold the balance of power, and in doing so, exert significant influence on the next government.

In the third leaders’ debate, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, normally pragmatic, refused to countenance sharing power with other parties or MPs. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton made the surprising [admission](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-22/federal-election-2025-dutton-albanese-campaign-trail/105198544) he would willingly make agreements with independent MPs in order to win.

He certainly wasn’t thinking of the “teals”, whom he so often [berates](https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/federal-election-2025-live-updates-treasurer-claims-second-debate-a-decisive-win-for-pm-labor-slams-dutton-s-comments-on-russia-indonesia-military-plans-20250416-p5lsa6.html?post=p58idj#p58idj) as “Greens in disguise”. But there are others with whom he could easily work. Katter, Spender and Le are among Dutton’s [preferred](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/30/australian-election-2025-hung-parliament-chances-what-happens) negotiating partners. Sharkie has already declared that in a hung parliament scenario, she would [call Dutton first](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/ill-call-peter-dutton-first-sa-crossbencher-rebekha-sharkie-boosts-coalitions-minority-hopes/news-story/fff22bb54a3df9c9f0872e786179f83c).

There is no rulebook for making a hung parliament work. In the past, new political configurations and coalitions have been born from hung parliaments, including the [forerunners](https://theconversation.com/as-the-liberal-national-coalition-marks-its-100th-birthday-will-it-survive-for-many-more-199511) of the Liberal-National coalition.

Agreements can be limited to assurances of support on budget bills and confidence motions, or more expansive undertakings including policy commitments and institutional reform. In the event of a parliamentary impasse, crossbenchers can withdraw their support and allow a new minority government to be formed. The Australia Institute’s Frank Yuan recently [pointed out](https://australiainstitute.org.au/post/election-entree-parliaments-changing-the-government/) seven changes of government have been triggered by the withdrawal of crossbench support. Indeed, during the second world war, two independent MPs effectively changed the government [mid-term](https://theconversation.com/the-forgettables-5-australian-prime-ministers-you-may-not-know-much-about-196360).

Much depends on the relationships forged at the start of a hung parliament. In his [memoir](https://www.mup.com.au/books/windsors-way-updated-edition-paperback-softback), former New England MP Tony Windsor recounts the seventeen days of negotiations that followed the 2010 election. One of the factors that led him, along with follow independent Rob Oakeshott, to support the Labor Party was the “professionalism” and “respect” its leaders showed them. Former Coalition leader Tony Abbott, by way of contrast, gave Windsor the impression he was unlikely to endure minority government long enough to honour any of his commitments.

An especially aspirational crossbencher may even take on the role of Speaker. Wilkie and Sharkie have been recently touted as [contenders](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/crossbench-mps-in-talks-with-labor-coalition-over-speaker-s-job-20250415-p5lryt.html) for the role in a hung parliament scenario.

**Reform hangs in the balance**

Independents MPs would be likely to bring particular policy priorities to any minority government negotiation. Given the heated contests in independent electorates, [truth in political advertising laws](https://australiainstitute.org.au/post/truth-in-political-advertising-laws/) would probably be high on the agenda. Steggall has previously promoted reforms to [Stop the Lies](https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/comment/topic/2025/02/13/truth-advertising-should-be-urgent-priority), but when the Albanese government chose not to progress its own version of this reform, independents [signalled](https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/teals-to-demand-truth-in-advertising-laws-in-hung-parliament-20250114-p5l45f) it would be high on their priority list in a hung parliament.

Crossbenchers – in both houses – might also treat recent changes to Australia’s electoral laws as a bargaining chip. Those changes, agreed between Labor and the Coalition in secret, promised to get big money out of politics by imposing donation and spending caps on everyone but with [special caveats](https://theconversation.com/sweeping-reform-of-the-electoral-laws-puts-democracy-at-risk-they-shouldnt-be-changed-on-a-whim-249144) for major parties. Haines has [declared](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-13/helen-haines-political-donations-reform-minority/104929724) these are “in her sights” if a hung parliament arises.

The menu of reform options gets wider from there. Spender has [called for](https://www.allegraspender.com.au/4821/economic_reform) labour market and tax reforms that may not be palatable to all of her peers.

In the Senate (where “every day is minority government”), Pocock has outlined his [firm demands](https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/politics/2025/04/12/exclusive-david-pococks-demands-minority-government) for greater royalties from resources rents and reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. Energy and climate policy, as well as support for rural Australia, would likely figure in a larger negotiation.

The crossbenchers would be hard-pressed to agree on everything, but there is strength and wisdom in numbers. Albanese and Dutton are both very experienced parliamentarians. Crossbenchers would likely need to put their heads together to exert maximum leverage.

If there is a hung parliament after May 3, history shows us it can be put to good use. The 43rd parliament, in which the Gillard government was in minority, was one of the most productive in recent history. It passed 561 bills including landmark measures such as the Clean Energy Future package and its centrepiece, a carbon price. It also passed needs-based funding for Australian schools, the National Disability Insurance Scheme and [plenty more](https://theconversation.com/independent-mps-are-elected-for-a-reason-hung-parliaments-may-be-precisely-what-voters-want-251900).

Parenting,kids off social media,How can I keep my ex from bullying our daughter about her car?,"The relationship between my ex and I is long, fraught, and would take pages to fully enumerate, but I’ve had issues with my ex bullying our daughter since we separated (we were never married) when my daughter was 3. This has ranged from my ex angrily asking her, “Why do you only cry when \*I\* pick you up?!” to repeatedly demanding that every holiday or special event scheduled during my custodial time be “inclusive to both parents” (since I’m an ER nurse and occasionally work holidays), while openly refusing to do the same in return. ""That’s *MY* time with her!"" Etc, etc.

""Luckily"" for me, my ex did this and worse in writing- emails, text, social media, etc- like when I was told I had to pay for our daughter’s braces in full because my ex was ""totally broke."" It turned out that my ex was ""broke"" because they had paid a $5,000 retainer to try and sue me for full custody. This meant that when my lawyer revealed everything during discovery, I got a settlement granting me full custody entirely on my terms. Pro tip, folks: it’s a bad idea to lie or withhold information from your lawyer. Still, our daughter wanted relatively equal time with both parents, which I agreed to. So, while we have the most custodial time, it’s still relatively even.

Since our daughter got a phone—one of the rare things my ex paid for in full, as it was totally against my wishes, giving her unrestricted use of a brand new iPhone at 10 years old—this behavior has only escalated. I’ve silently stewed about it and have tried to talk to our daughter in vague but serious platitudes when issues arise, being supportive without revealing my true, very unkind feelings. It’s been a constant battle not to openly badmouth my ex to our daughter or to go into explicit detail about what has happened. Instead, I validate her feelings and agree that the behavior is unwarranted (for instance, when my ex bombards her phone with texts and calls if she doesn’t respond quickly enough, only to berate her for being inattentive). I offer to intervene or call, which my daughter always declines—sadly, I think because she believes it will make things worse with my ex—and I make sure I never act anywhere close to that way with her.

Now, we’re looking at cars since our daughter is getting her license in a month, and the same issues have cropped up. You’ll be unsurprised to learn that, once again, *I’m* the one who has to pay because my ex simply ""cannot afford"" to contribute to insurance, licensing, gas, or the car itself. Totally predictable. My goal is to find a reliable car—nothing more. I don’t trust the kids at her high school to drive well, so a ""nice"" car is out of the question. As long as it gets her where she needs to go, I don’t care about dings, scratches, or age.

I offered to pay for gas and insurance if my daughter would do occasional things like take her little brothers to school in the morning and pick them up afterwards, or to run to get groceries with my credit card and offer her a perfunctory amount to get what she wants for herself. My ex hollered and screamed, claiming those stipulations were “holding it over her head,” whatever ""it"" is. My ex also demanded to be “involved” in finding a car, so I invited them to send me links or leads anytime they liked, while refusing to pay a cent for anything related to it. They’ve only done so once or twice, suggesting unreasonable things like brand-new Honda CRVs or Toyota 4-Runners, which I've ignored.

Finally, I found something we liked on Craigslist: a 2002 Honda Civic with relatively low miles. I was a little skeptical at first, but when I checked it out, it was as advertised- we'd looked at a couple cars previously, but those fell through (a Prius that ""oh by the way, forgot to mention"" needed a brand new $4,000 hybrid battery, for instance). This, though, there was nothing we’d have to fix urgently and no unexpected issues. So I took my daughter to see/drive in it, and she loved it. She was a little skittish about it being a manual transmission, having never driven one before, but I told her I hadn’t driven an automatic until shortly before she was born, and I’d be happy to teach her. The selling point for her, I think, was that it would truly be *her* car. So few people can drive a manual these days, and the vibe I got from her was that it would not only be a good car but also a point of pride to drive it. She also liked the performance exhaust it had—not that it would do much for a Honda Civic, but it sounded cool, I’ll admit.

And then my daughter made the mistake of sharing that excitement with my ex.

Sigh.

Now, I've been suspicious that my ex planned to use our daughter's car as a sort-of surplus car for themselves. While my ex has always had ""car troubles"" situationally- their car works amazingly when, say, they want to pick our daughter up from my house, but not when I'm going to be late to work in the ER and ask her to be dropped off as a favor- it seems like their car is, more and more recently, inoperable. Again, though I can't prove it, I also think they relished the thought of driving around in a car I bought and paid for. However, my ex- a Gen Xer five years old than I am, born during the Carter administration- apparently has never driven a stick shift ever, something I just assumed they'd have done, even if in the late 80s/early 90s.

Apparently not. My daughter and I were both subjected to a full spectrum barrage of how ""stupid"" a choice that a manual transmission car was, but my daughter was subjected to it in an order of magnitude more than I was. In fact, yesterday, all day at school, my daughter was subjected to ""don't you care about me and my thoughts and opinions"" and ""we are going to have a long and very serious talk when you get back home"" and so forth and so on. All day. During school.

So I picked her up from school on Thursday, and my daughter shakingly informed me she didn't think the car was right for her. I raised an eyebrow. ""This is a big departure from when we went for a ride in it,"" I told her. Yes, she said, but she'd had time to think more about the manual transmission and was really skittish about it, and just didn't think it was the right car. She asked me if that was okay, and I told her as long as it was her decision, then of course; I wanted her to get a car she would be happy with, within the parameters I listed above. After I said ""her decision"", she paused for a few moments and agreed it was her decision. However, we stopped for groceries at Costco and my daughter hung back in the previous aisle to leave my ex a voice note, and I heard her ask my ex to please stop messaging her, as she already decided to not get that car. Worse, I found out that after I went to work (I work 7pm-7am in the ER), my ex badgered my daughter until I went to sleep; her 11yo brother told me when I got home the next morning that he had heard her on the phone with my ex, repeatedly saying ""Please, let me go. I'm tired. I'm not getting that car. We don't need to talk about it anymore.""

Now, my daughter is almost 17, and on top of all this recently, she has been helping me with my mother/her grandmother, who has terminal leukemia and is now on palliative care. It's too late for me to send a message back in time and tell past me to keep my daughter from my ex to the greatest extent possible. I did what I did at the time because I thought it was the right thing; my daughter deserved to have time with both her parents, she wanted time with both of us, etc. But I don't know what else to do here; I didn't let my daughter know I'd overheard/knew of her extended conversations with my ex.

I did tell my daughter that I supported her, and I wanted her to be happy with the choice in vehicle we found to the greatest extent possible, and not to stress out about it to the greatest extent possible. But I dunno. I just don't feel like that's enough.

Any thoughts, any advice here would be helpful. My daughter doesn't like disparaging of her mom, which I understand, so I'm always careful in how I predicate what I say to her. But I feel totally at loss for what to do here to support my daughter other than what I'm already doing.",14,38,AintMuchToDo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1g85ns1/how_can_i_keep_my_ex_from_bullying_our_daughter/,2024-10-20 18:38:05,"r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

Why are you involving your ex so much? I think you honestly need better boundaries with them. She can tell them whatever she wants, but it's time to stop getting this person involved when they only bring misery. They won't pay, they won't be supportive, so stop telling them things they don't need to know.

I worry that at this point, your ex is wearing your daughter down so much that she won’t know how to trust her own gut and her own mind when she becomes an adult. It sounds like you need to start stepping in here to advise her some age appropriate truths about the situation, and how to manage your ex. This doesn’t have to be detrimental but absolutely needs to be factual. He’s literally wearing her down. He’s disrupting her sleep, her confidence, her ability to make choices. He’s abusing her. You cannot let this continue. I truly admire your calm presence in her life but the time to get passionate about this is NOW.

You need to have a conversation with your daughter about abusive relationships and narcissists. Because that’s what her dad is doing to her.

If she had a boyfriend act this way I hope you would try to steer her away from him. It really shouldn’t be that different just because it’s coming from a parent.",2024-10-20 18:38:05,False

It wasn't from a kind place, that's why you're annoyed. 

Your dad admitted it when he said he should be grateful to have a job and be smiling. 

It wasn't about the worker ACTUALLY feeling good. It was about calling out the worker for not having a grin and faking it for your dad's comfort. Your dad was not just calling them out, but putting them in their place. It was dehumanizing.

Please just hand me the receipt and go on your way. Obviously, it's fine to be nice, and if a joke organically happens, it's totally cool. But the people who try to mess around or tell me to smile are usually the worst. I'm just trying to do my job, I'm sure you're not all smiles at work either, buddy. 

It's not really a big deal in the long run, but it is annoying, and I *will* roll my eyes after they leave. That's my two cents, at least. I say, good on you for saying something, but he won't change, and it's fine. Just walk ahead or behind him if it bothers you lol
---
I've befriended the receipt checker at my local Walmart. 

He is struggling greatly with medical and familial problems. 

He's the nicest dude on the planet, I'm convinced. He doesn't always smile, because he is constantly suffering and he's a human being. 

Sometimes little jokes are okay, but you never know how the joke will be received. 

I've found that just being nice and friendly with everyone is the best way to be. 

I constantly compliment strangers if I like their shirt or whatnot. I do this with men and women alike.  Sometimes it takes people aback momentarily, but they quickly realize I'm just passing by and complimenting them. That's when they usually say, ""Thanks!"" as I walk on. Sometimes they will talk to me for a bit. 

I've made actual friends / lovers like this multiple times over my 45 years of existence. Just by being kind and friendly. 

It's weird. Being nice and not having ulterior motives goes a long way!

AskAnAustralian,young people and social media ban,"I feel like I don’t fit in - struggling finding a girl group, what to do from here?","I have always had a feeling I just don’t fit in. I have struggled making and maintaining friends over the years. Maybe I do it to myself but I tend to keep a distance from new girl friend ships because I am just not like them and am afraid of rejection. I suppose other people feel the same although it is just hard. I had a lot of child hood trauma which has affected my interpersonal relationship skills and self esteem. I know it sounds easy - join a group or club, sign up to sports, post on local social media platforms/pages but I still just can’t put myself out there. I have a few really close friends but don’t talk all that often or see each other and a loving partner who I spend most of my time with but I think he is beginning to feel a little annoyed because he wants his time and for me to have my own friends. I live in a very transient place and a lot of people are travelling, so that is another thing. No one is here for too long. I know in my heart I am a great person and friend to others I just don’t seem to get that in return all that often. Should I just accept that I won’t have that “girl group” that you see all over Instagram? I know you can’t trust social media but I look at the other girls and just wish that was me. I crave connection with people as I am an anxiously attached kind of person (working through dbt therapy weekly with my therapist to overcome this) but when social events come up Its like I start making excuses as to why I shouldn’t go. And when I am there I feel out of place and that really hurts. 
I have a van and spent most of my free time before my relationship travelling so am okay by myself but I guess right now I am just feeling lonely and want to vent. Are there other people out that don’t have a group and are happy?

If life is so interesting why must it be carefully documented and curated? Just live it. When I’m out having fun I rarely take photographs. Seeing groups carefully posing and arranging themselves for a photogenic moment seems so fake. My insta feed is mostly the things I love - jewellery, perfume, art, old photographs. I don’t want to see other people’s carefully curated social circles. 

Take all the stuff you see on social media with a very big grain of salt. Maybe an entire bulk bucket or Maldon from Costco.

This is me but I have ASD so people judge me as being a bit “weird” even if I haven’t done anything weird.  I’ve tried to say I’m just shy, but I get excluded or it stays at acquaintance level so I’ve given up.
---
Similar. Used to be always out and about and had loads of ""friends"" to socialise with. But as I've gotten older and I married a total introvert? I've realised that I don't really have lots of CLOSE friends at all. I more have friendly acquaintances! 

And I really think most people are like this? Those ""girl groups"" can be very toxic and competitive and if they are still going HAPPILY at 40? It's miraculous. Good on them suppose. 

Since i matured and got married at 30yrs of age? I don't even WANT to go on ""girls night's out"" or go away with a bunch of women. I suppose I MIGHT if it was a group of us that had been close at uni or such and we now all lived different places. So decided to meet somewhere central and get together. But I never really had that sort of ""group"" at uni anyway. I had people I  hung out with but once we finished uni and went on with our lives...we mostly lost touch.

I have most of these people who were my friends just on Facebook these days. I enjoy chatting to them on messenger etc. But that's about it. 

It's quite okay to be comfortable in  your own company! That's a GOOD thing. Maybe you could just find a few things to do as ""hobby"" that just get you out amongst other people. You don't need to make serious friendships. But just go and say do craft for a few hours. Chat and socialise...then don't think about it until next time.

You have to do YOU...don't judge yourself by looking at others on SM for sure! Most of it is fake and attention seeking nonsense.

fuck a girl group go find a table top group, bunch of freaks and weirdos in best sense, very little judgement quite welcoming

Parenting,kids off social media,Recommendations for slow/ low stimulating/ age appropriate shows for 6-year-old,"TLDR: I need recommendations for slower shows for my six-year-old.

After much discussion, research and inner turmoil recently, we seriously adjusted our family rules around television, iPad and mobile devices. We removed YouTube, Roblox, kids messenger and all high stimulation games from their iPad. We have also only been watching PBS kids on the tv, or a family movie occasionally in the evenings.  I deleted all of my social media (except Reddit obviously) off of my phone in solidarity as well. It’s truly been a peaceful couple of weeks, the behavior, sense of togetherness and all around tranquility have soared. PBS is great, but also pretty limited as far as shows for older kiddos. Any suggestions for slow and low stimulating shows for a six year old? We have access to most streaming platforms. Typically before the rule change they’d watch shows way more geared for pre-teens and the influence was overwhelming, I’d like some options more for their age.",13,49,BetterCommon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1741qsl/recommendations_for_slow_low_stimulating_age/,2023-10-09 20:13:51,"r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

privacy,Australia under 16 social media ban,"For Australians concerned about their privacy data used to train AI, read this, sign and share!","
Dear Aussies on Reddit,
As you might be aware, on June 26, Meta started collecting our personal data, as far as 2007, to train their AI.

Unlike the European Union, Australians have not been given the option to opt-out from this policy.

I have put a petition to the House of Representatives to order any social media channel now and in the future to allow users in Australia to opt-out from their private data being used to train AI created by these organisations. 

I believe in the right of privacy, and I believe as a matter of ethics that companies should not take for granted that they can use our personal information without being consulted for profit and most of all, for free. Many of us, joined these platforms to share our lives with friends and relatives, unaware these policies will be implemented.

AustralianPolitics,Albanese social media ban,Victoria Minor Candidates Debate Summary,"On 12 March 6 News hosted a debate between Victorian candidates with a realistic shot at the final Senate seat. This included One Nation, Legalise Cannabis, the Victorian Socialists and the Libertarian candidates.  This is a summary of what happened for those who don't want to watch an hour and a half, posted on Sunday because that's the day for personal posts such as these.  This debate was overall slightly more mature and as a result there's a lot more policy for me to cover.  South Australia will follow next week if there is as much interest in this one as there was for Queensland, as well as any future debates 6News sets up.


[The debate itself, if you want to watch it all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xpd8JKYGSs)

[Link to the only guy who was reporting on these that I could find](https://bsky.app/profile/anthonyzougras.bsky.social/post/3lk6alxaamx2j), just like last time.  Please can someone with a Bluesky watch the next ones.

**General observations**:
-	Because one of the debaters was an e-celebrity, the audience was always going to be majority pingers fans regardless of who was the best at debating or had the best points, because they’re there to see their guy.  Very clearly a lot of pingers fans but also a surprising amount of Libertarians in the audience.  I don’t think anyone will be surprised that pingers won in terms of the after-debate poll.

-	Fiona Patten won in terms of actual debating ability, but it doesn’t matter.  These types of debates, considering the sheer diversity of views on display, are extremely difficult to “win” in the public eye by being centrist and reasonable when there’s both a left and a right element present, and the audience wants extremes.  It’s also completely expected for her to be capable of pulling that off against two people with no political experience and a social media guy; she was an MLA for 8 years.  

-	More broadly, I really don’t know if there was much of a point at all between people so far apart debating, as neither side is going to convince the other and the gap is so big that anyone in the “middle” has a good dozen parties to pick from instead.  It is on some level good entertainment.  Nobody got a real shot away either, as while the debate itself has more views than Queensland, the Queensland highlights reel has an order of magnitude more than the Victorian highlights.

-	Nobody was genuinely awful in any way, or even really bad.  I hold Patten and pingers to higher standards because of their experience, but while nobody reached the stratospheric heights of Rennick in the last debate (whose debate highlight is the 9th most viewed video on their channel and is probably the only person to have gained many votes from this exercise) the SA and QLD debates definitely had far worse efforts.

-	The debate on the forbidden topic involved one side that sincerely believed the other was supporting terrorists and terrorism, and another that sincerely believed their opposites supported, or at least were neutral on, genocide.  Considering this, it was surprisingly polite.  I will generally avoid discussing the part of the debate covering that topic because I too think it’s devoid of value, but considering just how far the two sides are and the magnitude of the issues they have with their opponent, it’s remarkable that only a few swear words got thrown and nobody got truly angry.

-	Universal agreement that nobody thought their position was extreme, at least with proper historical and political context. 

-	Credit to Puglisi and his comedic chops for this question; “Mr Dittloff (Libertarian), do you think landlords are productive members of society?”  One guess at the response.


**Jordan Dittloff, Libertarian**

-	Impeccable dress, to the point that it almost looks like he’s overdressed.  Professional quality webcam, full suit and the only candidate so far with a Teams background, this being the Libertarian Party logo (update: Dianah Walter also had her logo, but her webcam was worse).  While he looks like someone who is obsessed with day trading, it is also an extremely professional look which as someone with no MLA or media experience is probably the way to go.

-	Clearly had done at least some reading on his opponent, and identified areas where both he and pingers agreed government spending should be reduced as well as coming pre-prepared with a question for Patten that she was unable to respond well to.

-	It’s Victoria; did you REALLY expect we’d get away without talking about COVID?  Pingers (why do you only talk about cannabis and not people’s wider lives) and Pickering (why do you preference Labor and the Greens, as in his opinion it’s in their interest to not legalise cannabis to keep that preference flow going) both take shots at Patten, but Dittloff is the one that has impact.  He asks her about voting for pandemic emergency measures in 2022, which helped secure the passage of the bill.  Her response is pretty wishy-washy, arguing that the formalised emergency powers helped provide a check on the government 

-	He does get away a little bit when nobody takes up his claim that COVID “wasn’t a deadly disease”, considering the deaths it caused even with lockdowns.

-	He straight up saluted Puglisi when his name was called out, which I thought was funny.

-	Begins with their ideological beliefs in small government, specifically saying that he/the party consider the Liberals as the least bad, but they no longer fit Menzies’ ideals.  Very brief opening statement, no policies mentioned.

-	“We don’t have a cost of living crisis, we have a cost of government crisis”, which as both him and Willmott repeated it verbatim, really does make me think that they had that line set up to say in advance.

-	Believes that the Cost of Living crisis is caused by government overreach, including areas that have “never previously been the purview of government”.  Claims that 83% of new jobs have been “government-funded jobs” (unsure how broad this is; could mean anything from public servants up to any job in an industry with government funding)

-	Wants the fuel and alcohol and tobacco excise gone, and alludes to increasing rates of black market cigarettes as an example of their failure.  Claims they are a “tax on the poor”.

-	Tax brackets gone, flat 20% income tax.

-	Implied that he does not support axing the NDIS entirely, selling the NBN or defunding abortions.

-	He wants to defund the ABC and abolish the eSafety Commission, cut all aid to Ukraine and all support for either side over the war in Gaza.  

-	Claims that the Department of Education would have benefits, as it has no teachers and “contributes nothing of value”.

-	As alluded to, believes that landlords are investing capital into an investment with risk, and that the market has incentives for landlords to find and keep tenants, instead of empty houses.  Believes that Victorian tenancy laws are too strict, and that is causing people to leave homes unoccupied to avoid having a tenant.  Specific examples he gives are allowing pets and allowing them to paint the house whatever colour they choose, and that these give them rights that are too close to owners.  

-	Agrees with pingers that landlords can be bad people but unfortunately the audio is horrible so I can’t tell you anything else. 

-	Supports withdrawing from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which in the context it was brought up involves housing standards. 

-	Believes that “migration… should generate a benefit for the existing society”.

-	Wants an immigration “auction” where a certain number of slots are given per month based on a percentage of the population (1 percent per annum), and they can be bought by employers or individuals for any reason.  Is implied he wants to get rid of at least immigration from the Department of Home Affairs.  

-	Claims that subsidies for aluminium smelters for the transition are an “internal tariff” and anti-competitive.  Also says Net Zero is a “fantasy”.

-	Support free trade and no tariffs of any kind.

-	Says that having a Senate seat would enable him to “shine a light on the system, the deep state in Canberra” and that it’s’ more useful than 1/76 seats in most debates.  He doesn’t seem to want an overthrow of the state but rather a massive reduction in the size.

-	“Weed without the woke” attack line again!  Also claims that they have policy beyond that of Legalise Cannabis, as a one issue party.  I will note that Patten is visibly laughing through this entire section.

-	Claims he stands for “civil liberties that actually matter”, which is the least veiled attack on Patten’s pandemic-era voting record of all time, and is taken correctly by her as such.


**Fiona Patten, Legalise Cannabis**

-	Fiona Patten served as an MLA for the Australian Sex Party/Reason between 2014 and 2022, and has spent most of her career as an advocate for sex workers, but in general is a progressive (small-l) libertarian.  While pingers is a media personality and has done interviews, she is the only former parliamentarian here and therefore I am holding her to higher standards.

-	For some reason I cannot understand, she has a decent backdrop (bar the RADICAL SEX LAWS sign, which makes sense in context but would probably alienate voters), is dressed well and presents well, but decided to film in a room with only two small lamps, which with the limited range of computer webcams is always going to destroy video quality.

-	Much of what she says appears to blur the line between what Legalise Cannabis the party and Fiona Patten the candidate believe; being a one-issue party, and with her having had previous party positions, this is inevitable.  As a result, please keep in mind anything I list as a “policy” outside of cannabis is likely more what Patten believes and would do on an issue than a consistent national platform.

-	Very strong performer and if it wasn’t for the final question I would have had her at the top of the list.  Considering the anchor around her neck that is a one-issue party, she stretched cannabis to its absolute limits and also had a good deal of initiative on other issues and showed a good eye for when others had misstepped.  She also appeared, despite literally being a politician, as surprisingly human.

-	They support legalising cannabis, good to know.

-	Opens by discussing her achievements as an MLA, claiming a “track record of being an effective crossbencher”.

-	Believes that CoL is the result of global issues, but that housing costs contribute.  While legalising cannabis will help create money, she acknowledges that it won’t single-handedly solve the issue.

-	Wants greater supports for those on Jobseeker and/or the homeless, as a way to alleviate the problems.

-	Does not support the NSW Libertarian platform of reducing services as part of reducing government.  Instead, wants more money into education as it will increase productivity, and therefore make us more competitive.   

-	Also against any cuts to “women’s reproductive health”.  I put that in quotations because nobody is specific on what should be cut.

-	Against abolishing the Department of Education.  Cites the Gonski Report as to how education could be improved without removing federal oversight.

-	Identifies that rent control is a state rather than federal issue.  Is ambivalent on it at a state level.  Says it was not mentioned in the inquiries she was involved with as an MLA.

-	Wants more homes built, especially for those who are at lower socioeconomic levels.  Generally supportive of the Albanese housing agenda, though she leaves the door open to supporting “some” Greens amendments.

-	Wants the term changed from “landlord” to “housing provider”, with the associated role shift and responsibility shift.

-	The party does not have a formal view on immigration!  Patten says they will base their response on “evidence, civil liberties, compassion, social justice, personal freedoms and human rights”.  Disagrees with One Nation and the Libertarians on immigration, and calls them “cruel and callous”.

-	Believes that we cannot isolate ourselves from the world, and that it is selfish to do so. Believes we have a responsibility to continue accepting immigrants as we have done in the past. 

-	Disapproves of our current asylum seeker policy.  

-	Australia should stand up to Trump and criticise him publicly.  Wants to “tax those tech bros”.  Tells the PM to grow a pair. 

-	Is asked about Jones’s comments on the hemp industry and stops short of agreeing, but says it can be used to build houses rapidly in many places.  In my opinion it read a lot like her trying to not throw her compatriot under the bus. 

-	Supports legal, regulated cannabis so that there are quality and control standards.  Disagrees with the Libertarians on this, and believes it will create a “dangerous product”.

-	Patten says that the party may establish other issues eventually, but are currently focused on one issue.  Says that you can look to the elected Legalise Cannabis MLA’s for an idea of what will happen if you vote for them on other issues.

-	Is happy with road law changes in Victoria around cannabis, where if you have a prescription and are not impaired, you will not be fined or lose a licence.

-	Believes she made the right choice around pandemic-era legislation, based on the evidence available at the time.

**Warren Pickering, One Nation**

-	He “works in the construction industry” and you can tell.  His appearance is easily the least qualified of the four, looking like he just came home from the worksite.  The others all look like some form of politician, while he looked like just a guy at home and had a webcam to match.  Lighting was decent but no background, which makes him the only person in either debate so far to have not even tried to have a relevant backdrop.

-	Generally just less effective than his far-right contemporary, both in having political knowledge and in the charisma to appear an effective debater.  Pingers caught him out multiple times with stats that he just didn’t have a counter to, which made him look uneducated and less across the issues.  While they might have disagreed vehemently, both pingers and Dittloff were consistently able to argue each other’s points without tripping up, and both clearly had deep knowledge of the topics.

-	Unfortunately, the primary reason I have him in third instead of fourth is part of the section I cannot talk about, and even then he didn’t exploit it properly.  But for a guy who kept fighting and losing it was a remarkable turnaround.

-	I do find it funny that Puglisi asks him after several minutes of Patten, pingers and Dittloff going at it over funding cuts, “Anything you’d like to cut?”.  Pickering says that everyone agrees government is too big and too expensive, but no specifics.

-	Migration is causing “existential demand” for housing.

-	Claims 70% increase in housing companies going insolvent in Victoria over the last two years.

-	Disagrees with the immigration auction idea.

-	Claims there are 75,000 people who are here illegally and that they should be deported immediately to “make an example”.  This likely explains what Roberts was referring to the other night, but with far more detail and justification.

-	Wants Net Zero migration, which is currently 135,000 people.  Agrees with Dittloff that mass migration is being used for artificial growth, but also says it is harming communities and gives a genuinely heartfelt concern about how his daughter doesn’t have the same opportunities he did as a young adult.

-	Wants to increase the amount of time before you can apply for citizenship to 8 years.

-	Says that asylum seekers should be settling in countries near them.

-	Will not be doing burqa-style theatrics. Says that we need “real people from the real world” in the Senate and as a Senator from a larger party he’d possibly be part of the balance of power.

-	Supports “a discussion” on full legalisation.  Also thinks that we should consider legalising MDMA.

**Jordan “purple pingers” van den Lamb, Victorian Socialists**

-	The thing that stuck out to me most was a lack of preparation.  Pingers was calm and assured on camera and had a good webcam setup, and spoke clearly and eloquently.  On subjects he knows intimately, he was also excellent.  Clearly, he’d put in some effort and if he wasn’t an above-average speaker he wouldn’t be where he is now.  But it was equally clear from some of the points that he hadn’t read his opponents platforms, such as when he was surprised the Libertarians oppose AUKUS (while this is not directly stated on their policy platform, they are against any foreign deployments).  Both Rennick and Dittloff showed that preparation and knowing your mark are so, so important in these debates and it just feels like a missed opportunity for him to attack one of the far-right parties.

-	He also struggled to escape the mold of a university socialist in talking and manner.  His way of speaking felt familiar to anyone who has ever dealt with SAlt on campus, with the phrasing and words used to make his arguments guaranteed to alienate anyone not already sympathetic, and his appearance and background were very stereotypical.  Even at the end, when Patten asked if everyone would agree to drinks (a softball question to humanise and bring together everyone) he was awkward while everyone else read the room and agreed (or in Puglisi’s case, made the “I’m too young” joke).

-	Many of his arguments felt as if they were to be used with people who already agree, rather than the undecided; Patten was far better at showing just why a policy would negatively affect regular people, rather than just stating it and assuming everyone would agree.  Considering a good chunk of the audience weren’t your typical purple pingers viewers, I really do think there was a missed opportunity, especially on the forbidden topic and any time Dittloff brought up cutting something that the average person would likely support keeping.  

-	When he did have arguments, I will say that unfortunately the stream kept cutting out on 6News’s end pretty frequently, which of course isn’t his fault and means that he may well have had much stronger arguments that we just didn’t hear.

-	Came straight out the gate by saying that the housing crisis is caused by capitalism and then again for the cost of living crisis not a minute later.  Wants “organising in our streets, workplaces and unions”.  

-	Wants to cut “the tens of billions of dollars to subsidize landlords”.  Very strong against Dittloff on the NDIS, where he does not support cuts.

-	The Victorian Socialists/pingers housing platform is far more reasonable than you might expect from his demeanour, as it’s a slightly amped-up version of the Greens platform.  Unfortunately I had to look it up because (and this isn’t his fault) the stream died on 6News’s end before we got into it.  When the stream returned he was talking about rent seeking.
-	Believes that building more housing will not improve quality (due to capitalism incentivising sub-standard construction).

-	Migration isn’t causing the housing crisis, a lack of government intervention is causing it.  Wants a public builder and rent controls (5 years per his website, then CPI).

-	Doesn’t like AUKUS, B-52’s in Darwin and a casual “if they exist” surrounding the potential of Australia and the US having mutual enemies.

-	Will represent the working class in parliament, but there’s a strong undertone that any meaningful change will be extraparlimentary and outside democratic norms.  The fact that he wants to **overthrow the government** is dropped as a casual, indirect aside an hour into a debate.  Easily the most extreme thing said by anyone at any point. 
 
-	Will take the median wage if elected, and use the rest to “amplify community organising” as well as help striking workers.

-	Wants legalisation but believes that there are more important issues on the table.",12,12,Thomas_633_Mk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/1jhqemc/victoria_minor_candidates_debate_summary/,2025-03-23 03:37:12,"Excellent write up as always! I do think that Patten edged out Dittloff, but overall this debate was less 'interpersonal rivalries leading to a bar fight"" than the last one, so it was a more informative listen. Excited for the SA write up as well!

Sorry, but with the exclusion of Patten. They all sound remarkably embarassing. Nothing will get the average punter back to the majors quite like ""debates"" like this.

Interesting and again thanks so much for taking the time to do this

Just from reading this Patten does come across as the most reasonable overall although I'd likely align more with u/purplepingers ideologically. Good point that you raised on some LC policies and some Patten policies as it does seem like a more fleshed out platform than LC itself has

Pickering sounds marginally more moderate than the QLD brand of One Nation which I guess is necessary in Victoria

Interesting point on pingers being better at playing to the base than winning over swing voters, that could be an issue for VS going forward

Very interesting/entertaining report, thank you! I’m excited by your thoroughness and willing to call anyone out :-)

Fiona Patten - formerly the Sex party later re-branded to the Reason Party. I THINK she only got initially elected to make preference-whisperer Glen Dury $40k richer. But will stand corrected on that. 

Got her sex worker legislation through. And it was fine but hardly one of this States’ top 50 issues. Whoopie Do. 

Then voted with Andrews incessantly. Including once promising not to extend lockdowns, but then giving Andrews permanent power to do that, which he did. (Basically they took the power from the CHO to the Worlds lockdown King.). 

I hope she fails dismally. Fuck off Fiona.",2025-03-23 03:37:12,False
AskAnAustralian,young people and social media ban,Question for parents- Birthday parties invitations ( received/ reciprocated),"As a 40 year old male I never have had a birthday party ( my first party and only party) was our wedding.. fast forward we have a 11 year old boy , my wife has always wanted to make his birthday special and we have had parties every year from big events at the Park where lots of kids get invited to this year was a small party ( 5 boys taken to the movies and then back to our house for pizza and play station type of things) however he never gets invited to any other party .. my wife has just seen on Facebook his 'best friend' having a party and he wasn't invited, I don't mind about the party as such ( as explained first I don't fully understand them ) but how as a parent do you process the information that your child's friendships are not both ways , He is a kind hearted young man who loves to play and is very social, He never gets into trouble at school or home, He has his quirks but genuinely nothing outrageous, when people say all they want for the kids is to be healthy and happy I'm all for that , it actually hurts to think that his friends are one way ... from our point of view...how do you reconcile the emotions ( hurt vrs the optimism that he will find his people)?

My kid has had the same issue when at primary school. They'll find out when they get to school on Monday, so no use hiding it. But can you do something special with them this weekend that will soften the blow? Special movie & homemade popcorn night, trip to a park or other activity you know you'll both love & enjoy?
It could be that the kid who's having the party wasn't able to invite everyone (parties are expensive), it may be good for your kid to build a bit of resilience, but having that something special & fun to focus on may help immensely come Monday.

Having been there I can relate! Shy not outgoing and little quirky- not included at that age but truthfully he didn’t care, moreso us! Mind you I did get smug chuckles when his outgoing gregarious adhd mate made huge scenes at parties hyped up on sugar, once biting chunks out of a birthday cake!! My child would never have done this! This was before social media- so I’d suggest stepping back don’t let it phase you. Your child will find their people, as mine has.
---
Ouch! That hurts my heart. I wish parents would be more mindful about kids’ social dynamics. Does your son have any little friends outside of school? Because building up a nice friendship group via extra curricular stuff is the only thing I can think to suggest.
---
Tough.. i have never understood how parents can take their kids to other kids parties... Then not reciprocate? 
So sad for the kid like your son. 
Sorry. No help as as far as i know, this didn't happen to us. 
Well... Probably did😯 but we didn't realise and we got enough invites.
---
Being honest works for us. But, it could just be the circumstances of our primary school/social group. We all live in tiny apartments in a densely packed part of Melbourne - no one has room to host a party, and paying for a large external gathering is not an option for a lot of families. Most “parties” consist of taking a friend or two to the cinema or similar, and that’s it. People with family close by will do a family dinner. 

I told my daughter she’s not going to be invited to everything, and she knew that when her birthday rolled around, she couldn’t invite her entire class. We took her and another kid to the zoo, and it was great. 

The kids are fine. You’re doing fine. Don’t overthink it.",2024-10-19 05:33:57,False

AustralianPolitics,Albanese social media ban,AI job losses: Science and Industry Minister Tim Ayres sees power in an AI union,"Science and Industry Minister Tim Ayres has signalled a bigger role for trade unions in influencing how Australian companies incorporate artificial intelligence advances into their work practices, amid growing concerns that AI could replace swathes of white-collar jobs.

The government is [under pressure from business](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5m3vs) to set clear rules of engagement for the development and deployment of AI. Ayres has inherited responsibility for AI regulation after [usurping Ed Husic](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5lxwi) in Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s cabinet.

Tim Ayres says unions need to be part of the conversation when companies are implementing AI. Alex Ellinghausen

Dario Amodei, the chief executive of leading AI agent maker Anthropic, last week warned that bots could [wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar](https://www.afr.com/chanticleer/ai-could-kill-wfh-and-send-unemployment-to-20pc-are-you-really-ready-20250530-p5m3jc) jobs and send the US unemployment rate soaring from 4.2 per cent to between 10 per cent and 20 per cent in the next five years.

In a speech to *The Australian Financial Review’s* AI Summit in Sydney on Tuesday, Ayres will say workers’ concerns about the adoption of AI should be heard through greater union advocacy.

“Economic growth and productivity, and AI’s role within that, means  
so much in terms of the world of work, higher wages, opportunity and  
social equity,” Ayres will say according to a copy of his speech.

“Because we are a Labor government, it means delivering good jobs,  
more economic opportunity for women and men through all of Australia’s  
suburbs and regions.

“I will be looking in particular at how we can strengthen worker voice and agency as technology is diffused into every workplace in the Australian economy and I look forward to working with our trade union movement on all of this.”

Workers’ fears about losing their jobs to AI bots have led to a [surge in union membership](https://www.afr.com/technology/canva-atlassian-employees-flock-to-unions-amid-ai-job-fears-20250520-p5m0rl) at the country’s two highest-profile technology companies, Canva and Atlassian.

The tech sector has typically had very low unionisation because of the high salaries, a wide variety of job opportunities and generous workplace perks on offer.

While the registration of around 100 employees to the tech union, Professionals Australia, represents a tiny fraction of Canva and Atlassian’s total staff, it will be a trend start-ups and large enterprises will be closely watching.

Ayres will say in his speech that the digital economy and the adoption of artificial intelligence is core to future productivity growth.

“Working carefully to make sure that AI adoption makes jobs better means finding ways of working co-operatively with workers and their unions to make sure we have a shared approach to tech adoption in every workplace in Australia.”

The push for workers to unionise and set rules for AI engagement will be closely watched by big businesses.

The chief executives of Australia’s biggest companies are increasingly focused on making sure they are at the cutting edge of innovations coming out of Silicon Valley.

Telstra chief executive Vicki Brady has made a big bet on AI being the key strategic tool of the decade, including establishing a [$700 million joint venture ](https://www.afr.com/companies/telecommunications/it-s-like-a-marriage-inside-telstra-and-accenture-s-ai-reinvention-20250422-p5ltf1)with consulting giant Accenture, which will last for seven years and see the two organisations work together to develop new tools.

Brady and other local business leaders including CBA chief executive Matt Comyn and NAB’s Andrew Irvine recently travelled to Seattle to soak up the latest AI developments from Microsoft and its big name ally OpenAI at the tech giant’s annual CEO Summit.

Commonwealth Bank and Telstra both now have US offices near the AI giants, where they send staff for short rotations to learn from their big tech partners. How these tech specialists fare, as AI bots become more capable of replicating their roles, will become an increasingly vexed issue for chief executives to grapple with.

“There’s a big difference between big companies that are navigating that transition well and successfully, which is not necessarily easy,” Comyn said last month.

Ayres will say in his speech on Tuesday that his core job in the ministry will be to drive the Future Made In Australia policy forward. He said this would require collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders with different aims, including the tech industry, science and research establishments, venture capitalists and other investors and trade unions.

“Investments in digital infrastructure like energy hungry AI data centres  
go squarely toward our national advantages, and our national interest,” Ayres says.

“Australia’s status as a ‘five-eyes’ economy with stable governance, our  
geography at the edge of the fastest growing region of the world in human history with an insatiable demand for digital products and infrastructure, and our future energy advantage all position Australia as the top tier for global investment.”

On Monday, the Business Council of Australia nominated the sluggish approval process for new data centres as an impediment to Australia making a fortune from the AI boom.

[Data-centre operators recently locked horns](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5m2ha) with the NSW government after it imposed a ban on new facilities in Sydney’s Macquarie Park technology hub to allow more housing in the area.

“There is dissatisfaction right across our economy, at all different levels, in terms of how the approval systems work,” BCA chief executive Bran Black said. “If we’re intent on making data centres a priority for Australia then we absolutely need to get on top of that.”",12,23,Leland-Gaunt-,https://www.afr.com/technology/ayres-sees-power-in-an-ai-union-20250602-p5m480,2025-06-02 19:51:25,"**Greetings humans.**

Many children and young people themselves also internalize their own oppression and their legal and cultural marginalization and thinking their's something wrong with their generation with adults.

AskParents,social media age restriction Australia,My mom doesn’t have any friends,"My mom is near retirement age and has lived alone for the past four years while i've been in college. She's struggled with friends because we live in a very white, upscale neighborhood while we are lower income and english is not her first language. The rest of our family lives in China so it is just my mom and I in the US. She works 7am-5pm with minimal human contact and comes home scrolling on her phone everyday. Since she lives alone, she is always on high alert for her safety and she only leaves the house for work and groceries. 


She said she enjoys the peace and solitude but I feel like it's affecting her. She spends all her free time on Wechat (Chinese social media) everyday which seems like an echo chamber, and she rambles to me nonstop about the same stories everyday, not even letting me get a word in to speak or holding a conversation. It is literally just an hour or her talking nonstop and me nodding every now and then to confirm that I'm listening. I will even be doing a workout or on my phone watching videos and she will keep talking. And it's always the same stories of her childhood or from my childhood. I feel like I haven't had many productive or meaningful conversations with her because every time I try to contribute something she will turn it back to another story. It's been getting on my nerves and I feel so guilty because she's my mom and it can't be easy living alone, but I don't know what to do about it?",12,4,bdjekej,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskParents/comments/1hjsru4/my_mom_doesnt_have_any_friends/,2024-12-22 06:15:50,"Thank you u/bdjekej for posting on r/AskParents.

Yeah she sounds lonely but even when I'm lonely I'd want to hear about my children's day. Maybe ask her to try and join a female only gym or get into some sort of hobby, I would say in the meantime limit contact and if she asks about it then tell her it seems like she doesn't care about hearing about anything new with you, you feel unheard.

Honestly, with older people I think it’s a balance between managing your expectations and maintaining healthy boundaries. It does sound like she would benefit from friends though. Is she open to meeting new people or trying things like tai chi or mahjong? Or maybe a pet? But ultimately she is her own person and you’re not responsible for meeting her needs for companionship.

How much do you take her out when you’re home? Even just dinners or to movies or to events, especially since it’s the holidays?  What sort of cultural groups exist nearby?

AustralianPolitics,young people and social media ban,Major / minor,"**With a minority government more than likely, why are the major parties abandoning the issues that voters care about?**

**Richard Denniss, April 2025**

In 2022, Anthony Albanese swept into majority government despite a swing away from Labor of 0.8 per cent compared to Bill Shorten’s primary vote in 2019. Luckily for Albanese, Scott Morrison had driven away 5.7 per cent of Liberal voters. And as any political strategist will tell you, a messy win is better than a clean loss.

But three years later the steadily shrinking major parties seem more focused on changing electoral laws than reflecting on why a growing portion of voters clearly prefer minor parties and independents. The result of their lack of curiosity will most likely be a minority government after the imminent federal election.

Despite the rise of Donald Trump, the rise in inequality and the rise in global temperatures, Australia’s major political parties can’t seem to stop fighting each other over minor issues. Declining trust in our governments, and even declining faith in our democracy, are no accident – they are fuelled by the prioritisation of partisan politicking over the willingness of our parliaments to solve the big challenges facing the nation.

It’s clear that students are angry that their HECS repayments contribute more revenue to the Commonwealth than the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax. Norway taxes its fossil fuel industry and gives young Norwegians free degrees. Australia subsidises fossil fuels and charges students more than $50,000 for a degree. Of course they want a better deal.

It’s no wonder women are angry that despite years of talking and targets the gender pay gap remains at just under 22 per cent. They know that unless they get bigger pay rises than men that gap will never close. But they also know successive governments have not been willing to admit that simple truth. Morrison even said he supported women getting ahead, just not at the expense of men!

No one is surprised that young people saving for a home are angry that house prices are rising faster than their wages. They know that HECS repayments and expensive childcare make saving for a home harder still. And they know that successive governments have preferred tax cuts for high-income earners rather than free education or free childcare for them.

Who can blame Indigenous Australians for being angry that having had their request for a Voice to Parliament overwhelmingly rejected, the 2025 election will, like most before it, be conducted as if the world’s oldest civilisation barely exists?

And voters who care for the natural environment are angry to discover that simply removing Morrison hasn’t led to any change in Australia’s subsidised support for fossil fuel expansion. Not only has Tanya Plibersek approved four new coalmines and more than 100 new gas wells, but, despite having promised “no new extinctions”, she has refused to save the Maugean skate from salmon farms or protect black cockatoos from a bauxite mine.

More than five months after Trump’s re-election as United States president, the prime minister is yet to give a major speech on what the US retreat from rules-based order means for Australia. To be fair, neither Peter Dutton, Penny Wong nor the virtually invisible Coalition spokesperson for foreign affairs David Coleman have done so either. What are voters to think?

Likewise, more than five years since some of Australia’s worst bushfires killed 34 people and destroyed 3500 homes, neither Albanese nor Dutton will talk about a timetable for ending the approval of new gas and coalmines. Energy Minister Chris Bowen says that “no new fossil fuels” is a slogan not a policy, but actually it’s a policy supported by the United Nations, the International Energy Agency, more than 100 Australian scientists and a majority of Australian voters.

And despite the fact that unemployment benefits in Australia are so low that even the Business Council of Australia thinks they should be increased, neither of the self-described “parties of government” have even hinted that lifting the poorest people out of poverty is on their to-do list. We can’t fix inequality if we won’t help those on the lowest incomes.

Australia is one of the richest countries in the world, but we have been made to feel poor. The resources industry keeps telling us exports are booming, but we also keep getting told we can’t afford to have the nice things they have in northern Europe. The disconnect is easy to explain: Australia is one of the lowest taxing countries in the developed world, and the fossil fuel companies that make enormous profits selling our resources like it that way. Indeed, more than half the gas we export is given away for free.

Not all countries are as afraid to tax the fossil fuel industry as Australia, or indeed to tax property owners, retirement savings or billionaires. But if those elected to our parliament were brave enough to simply collect the average amount of tax, as a share of gross domestic product, collected by OECD countries, then the result would be an extra $135 billion per year in revenue. If we wanted to tax in the manner of Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland, we would collect an extra $330 billion per year. To be clear, if we did nothing more radical than copy the Nordic tax system we could afford to pay for the entire AUKUS program with one year’s worth of extra revenue. Just imagine the real problems we could solve.

But don’t hold your breath waiting for a debate between our major political parties on the costs to Australians of being one of the lowest taxed countries in the world. 

Albanese has shown himself to be a good manager and poor leader. His government has been cohesive, scandal free and overwhelmingly focused on delivering the promises he made when Morrison was PM. While his small-target strategy succeeded in showing voters just how shambolic the Morrison government was, his lack of policy ambition was neither what voters wanted (hence the fall in Labor’s primary vote) nor what the economy he inherited needed.

Labor came to power just before consumer prices and mortgage interest rates surged. While it wasn’t Labor’s fault that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine drove up energy prices, or that Philip Lowe broke his promise not to raise interest rates, it was Labor’s job to manage those problems. But it’s hard to manage new problems when you are laser-focused on old promises. It took the PM two years to shift $80 billion in Morrison’s so-called Stage 3 tax cuts for high-income earners into cost-of-living relief for low- and middle-income earners. It was the boldest, and most politically successful, decision he made this term.

And just two days later, the great tax debate was over. Dutton was in no mood for a fight with Labor about tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners. Likewise, he was quick to match Labor’s promise of $8.5 billion in new Medicare spending. The opposition leader’s reluctance to fight with Labor about inequality or health comes from the same old playbook that led Albanese to support the Stage 3 tax cuts and AUKUS in the 2022 campaign. The golden rules of major party campaigning have become: don’t have big fights about big things; don’t let yourself get “wedged” on significant issues; make your opponent’s weaknesses the story.

Albanese’s and Dutton’s whole political careers have been shaped by the belief that Australian elections are won in the marginal seats and that voters in marginal seats are influenced by the daily media cycle. But Australian politics is changing faster than the strategies of the major parties. The electorate, around a third of which voted for a minor party or independent in 2022, simply doesn’t accept that only marginal seats should matter and nor does it fear minority government as much as the major parties do. New South Wales is currently in minority government and few people even realise.

The idea of an electoral pendulum, with a national swing that sweeps so-called marginal seats from one party to another, is next to useless in Australia today. In a world where few people read newspapers or get their news from the TV at 6pm, there is literally no such thing as a “national mood”. In 2022, there was a swing of 11 per cent towards Labor in Western Australia and a swing against them of 2 per cent in Tasmania. Talking about the “average swing” is as meaningless as talking about the average temperature across our vast continent. 

Just as old fashioned is the idea that elections are still fought in a handful of marginal seats while the rest of the country stands impotently by. At the last election, the first-time independent candidate Sophie Scamps won the seat of Mackellar, which was regarded as one of the “safest” Liberal seats in the country with a pre-election margin of 13.2 per cent. If a brand-new candidate can win a seat with a 15.7 per cent swing, then 120 of the 150 seats in the lower house now need to be thought of as marginal.

And then there’s the Australian left–right spectrum that the media can recognise instantly but is unrecognisable to any economist or historian. Dutton is so “right wing” that he only trusts the public sector to build and own the $300 billion worth of nuclear power stations that he wants. If he has been asked about the impact of his penchant for enormous public-sector spending on our debt and deficit I must have missed it. 

Likewise, Albanese is so “left wing” that he supports Australia buying nuclear submarines from the US while opposing calls to increase unemployment benefits or extending Medicare to cover dental costs because of “fiscal responsibility”. Voters figured out a decade ago that differing interest groups rather than deep ideology separated the major parties.

As the election of Trump makes clear, elections matter. But while the US electoral system forces people to choose between two major parties, Australia’s has the incredible pressure relief valve of preferential voting. At the 2022 election only a tiny fraction of candidates were elected with more than 50 per cent of the primary vote, but every one of the 4.6 million votes cast for minor parties or independents helped to either elect one of the 16 crossbench members of the lower house or to decide which of the other candidates were elected. The genius of preferential voting means that no valid vote can ever be “wasted”.

The rise in political support for minor parties and independents, from 7 per cent in 1975 to 32 per cent in 2022, is not inherently good or bad. It is simply a reflection of the changing relationship between the values and priorities of voters and the agendas put forward by the major parties.

It is a mainstay of Australian politics that on election night the losing leader declares that voters always get it right. But in an era in which faith in all of our institutions is fraying, there is a growing tendency to suggest that if citizens elect a minority government they have somehow got it wrong. As a small-d democrat, I find such conclusions not just confusing but dangerous. 

It is clear that most Australians want to rein in the gambling industry, tax the fossil fuel industry, and receive better and cheaper essential services. It is also clear that other countries have managed to deliver such a package. If the major parties were really concerned with their declining primary votes they could always try spelling out a big plan to make the country better and try to win a debate with those who disagree with them. 

As Trump’s return shows, people who are desperate for change will try anything. Low-income voters were more afraid of the status quo than they were of the radical changes Trump promised.

Luckily for Australia, our system doesn’t simply require the choice between two parties. And, in turn, Labor and the Coalition can either decide to offer a more attractive agenda to voters or decide to work with the other candidates and parties who do. Time will tell which it is.

The fundamental problem here is media control. Every single problem that's been listed in the article... i can name a lobby group that will spend tens of millions to topple the government that dares to do it. Even the so called neutral national broadcaster will go along for the ride. It's why our government is paralysed and can't seem to do the big policy shifts that will benefit most Australians. 

Anyone remember the campaign to topple Kevin Rudd and the resources super profits tax. Tony Abbott became PM with his debt and deficit bullshit that got constant airtime even on the ABC. The calls to fix negative gearing and how we ended up with Scott morrison and his prosperity Christianity bs.

Labor could have this election in the bag if it grew some balls and actually took a stand on major issues. Instead we get the majors fighting over a 150 a year tax cut in 2026 or a fuel cut of 0.15 cents on the litre while our biggest “ally” has finally gone insane from the ingesting too much of its own propaganda and is laser focused on destroying itself, our housing and tax system is completely fucked and we pay corps to rob us or our natural resources. It’s fucking pathetic, no wonder people want other options

AskAnAustralian,Online Safety Amendment Act 2024,"Those who have worked for Coles or Woolworths, what was your experience like? ","Mine has been pretty good. 

  


In case you wanted some more detail:

I'm ashamed to say I've worked for both Woolworths and Coles, both cut from the same rotten bit of cloth.

I recently had to fill out a questionnaire that asked me what I've learned in my time with them: I've learned that other employers aren't so bad after all, I've gained empathy for people who work for these companies, and I've built some fortitude I guess.

I worked nightfill then as an assistant manager at Woolies and it was hellish  for many reasons.

I'm currently at liquorland now and they're running a slave ship with a skeleton crew. At Christmas. They simply refused to hire more team members even though we make about 100k a week, and now they've had to lay in the grave they dug because half of us have covid, one is down south, one is overseas and the store is had to close for a day so they lost about 20k in potential sales. It brings a smile to my face.

I'm a casual, and when I told my manager I couldn't work a day in two weeks time he said sorry he needs me because there's nobody else available. I said that's not my problem, I'm a casual and I'm telling you I can't work it. He begged me, tough shit. Somehow I was the bad guy for doing what I am entitled to do, one of the benefits of being casual.

Often they will leave me in the store on my own for half the day and pressure me not to take my lunch break (they will pay you for it but still it's a 1st world country you should be able to take a lunch break)

I walk past other retailers and they have three times as many staff with half the customers.

Their computers and software are ancient, constantly breaking down and taking days or weeks to fix.

My shirt got ripped while I was unloading stuff the other day and when I tried to order a new one I discovered that it would come out of my pay. I've been there for 7 months and they can't even afford me another shirt. I'll keep wearing the ripped one.

The online training is pathetic and there is basically no real life training. I had to ask them to teach me how to do everything and  they grudgingly showed me as if I was supposed to magically figure it out.

One of my coworkers was underpaid by 16 hours a month ago and they're still trying to chase up their pay 

It's not just one bad manager, I've been in multiple stores and it's basically all the same bullshit.

They even left an 18 year old girl on her own to close a store without telling her how to open the safe or what the alarm code and she called me up crying.

Once I grabbed my bag and starting walking out after they tried to deny my lunch break but I turned around only because I knew it would put even more load on my team mates.

Every retail job I've had was dysfunctional to some degree but Coles and Woolworths are the bottom of the barrel.

Money grubbing scum.

They preach the importance of safety and wellbeing but the ridiculous KPIs set by these vulturous executives who get paid 4 times what we do are impossible to meet while working safely. Just look at Woolworths recent warehouse worker strike.

Meanwhile underpaying farmers and delivery drivers and price gouging the public during a cost of living crisis and revealing what cold blooded reptiles they are when confronted about it.

There should be at least one state owned supermarket chain to ensure that people can buy essentials at reasonable prices, during pandemics and recessions and whatever dark times lay ahead.

And they don't seem to understand the simple fact that a tree will not continue to beat fruit if you neglect to water it.

Or maybe they think there is an endless supply of desperate workers who will jump through their hoops.

When you're under the gun the customer service slips -  If I'm supposed to put away 6 cages by myself I will focus on that over customers, sometimes I even find myself getting annoyed and ignoring customers who should be the focus in a retail store.

These leeches will drain you for every drop of blood they can - don't give them more than they deserve.

Plus unless you're vying for a promotion (which I'm not because I'm jumping off this sinking ship as soon as I line up something else) then there is literally no reward for working hard. No financial incentive and often it's not even acknowledged.

'Guys we did over 150k this week'

Literally why the fuck should I give a shit? The regional manager gets to visit Fiji with his fat bonus now? All it means is that we are run off our feet every shift and leave work exhausted.

So I act my wage now and take breaks and work at a reasonable pace and if that's not good enough for them they can fire me, it will be like releasing me from prison. I also make sure I shop anywhere but coles and woolworths where I can

If everyone had this attitude they wouldn't be able to make such unreasonable demands.

My experience seems to line up with everyone else I've spoken to who worked for these tyrants

> Often they will leave me in the store on my own for half the day and pressure me not to take my lunch break (they will pay you for it but still it's a 1st world country you should be able to take a lunch break)

If you are the only one and you need to take a lunch break, do you close the store? I mean I can't really think of an alternative other than eating at the front. But then you're not really on break, you're on guard duty.

AustralianPolitics,Online Safety Amendment Act 2024,Northern Beaches Hospital failing community: NSW auditor-general,"**‘Would Joe be alive?’ Family demands answers after scathing audit**

**Angus Thomson and Kate Aubusson, Updated April 17, 2025 — 3.12pm first published at 10.32am**

The family whose two-year-old son died after a series of failures at Northern Beaches Hospital has demanded to know why the NSW Labor government knocked back the chance to take over the public arm of the hospital almost 18 months ago, despite repeatedly calling the public-private partnership a disaster that should never have been greenlit.

A scathing independent [report by NSW Auditor-General Bola Oyetunji](https://www.audit.nsw.gov.au/our-work/reports/northern-beaches-hospital) released on Thursday reveals the hospital’s private operator, Healthscope, requested that the public portion of the hospital be returned to the government in November 2023 and that it had made the request again a month later.

The audit found the controversial public-private partnership “creates tension between commercial imperatives and clinical outcomes”, and the hospital had failed to act on warnings about risks to patient safety and outcomes.

It found the hospital’s electronic medical record systems “present quality and safety risks”, which Healthscope and the government’s Northern Sydney Local Health District had known about since the hospital opened in 2018.

The hospital’s poorly connected dual electronic medical record system was a critical factor in the death of two-year-old [Joe Massa in September 2024](https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/sydney-hospital-under-fire-over-death-of-two-year-old-boy-20250220-p5ldme.html). The hospital had failed to respond urgently to a heart rate in the “red zone” and it had failed to respond to serious concerns from clinicians and the boy’s parents.

The audit found that neither Healthscope nor the Northern Sydney Local Health District had taken sufficient action to address this risk.

Health Minister Ryan Park said Healthscope was responsible for the hospital’s IT systems, but that steps were being taken to address the issues identified in the review into Joe’s death.

“What we are now trying to do is make sure they upgrade that system to improve its operability across their hospital,” he said.

Joe’s mother, Elouise Massa, said she had not been aware of Healthscope’s 2023 offers until Thursday.

The audit says that, when Healthscope made the two offers, it raised concerns about the long-term viability of the hospital, citing insufficient funding, a lack of integration into the wider health network and “strained stakeholder relationships”.

Elouise Massa said she would seek answers from the government about what actions it had taken to address these concerns.

“Would Joe be alive had the government taken a more active role? I am not sure of the answers. However, these are questions we will be asking of the government,” she said.

Park on Thursday said he did not believe Joe’s life would have been saved if the government had stepped in. “I don’t want to make that type of link,” he said.

He said the government rejected the 2023 offers because it would have cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.

NSW Treasurer Daniel Mookhey described them as an attempt by Healthscope’s owner Brookfield “to get a big cheque on the way out”.

“What Healthscope was doing was trying to get us to buy them out at a premium,” Mookhey said.

The auditor-general stopped short of recommending that the government buy back the hospital but he said there was a risk the state might need to assume responsibility for public services earlier than the expected end date of 2038.

Park said the government would accept the auditor-general’s recommendations in full.

These included concerning results for some hospital-acquired complications, elevated rates of falls, serious perineal lacerations (tears) and birth trauma.

The audit said Healthscope’s recent financial challenges, which have prompted its owners Brookfield to [seek to sell the business it bought for more than $4 billion in 2019](https://www.smh.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5lm0g), were “an ongoing risk for NSW Health to manage”.

A Healthscope spokesman said the audit was further proof the partnership was “severely challenged, and no longer compatible with the NSW government’s policy objectives”.

The company was addressing the issues highlighted by the audit, he said.

Healthscope won the $2.14 billion contract to build and operate the hospital for 20 years under a public-private partnership signed by the former Coalition government.

“The whole premise of the public-private model was to deliver the same quality service as  
the public system for less money,” said Michael Regan, the independent local MP for Wakehurst who initiated the audit. “The results are in. This experiment has failed.”

Opposition health spokeswoman Kellie Sloane said the Coalition signed the contract in 2014 “with the best of intentions to produce world-class healthcare for the northern beaches”.

“To a large extent, it has done that. But what this report has done is it has revealed both the areas where the hospital did well \[and\] where there were failures,” Sloane said. “Those failures should never happen again.”

Joe Massa’s death in September led the government to outlaw future public-private partnerships under legislation dubbed “Joe’s Law”, and is now the subject of a coronial inquiry.

A parliamentary inquiry will further examine the safety and quality of services at the hospital. Public submissions close next month.

In February, Leah Pitman and Dustin Atkinson lost their newborn Harper after Pitman suffered a placental abruption during labour at the hospital. An obstetrician called for an emergency caesarean but this was not performed, and the baby was delivered vaginally.

The hospital’s operating theatres operate under an on-call arrangement from Friday to Sunday, during which time surgeons and theatre staff must be within half an hour of the hospital. Pitman went into labour on a Saturday.

Healthscope has launched an investigation into the tragedy. [The couple told ABC TV’s *7.30* program on Wednesday](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-16/harper-atkinson-death-northern-beaches-hospital-parents-speak/105180276) that, in a meeting with senior staff, they were told it was not “economically” feasible to run a 24/7 theatre.

“If we drove half an hour down the street to Royal North Shore, Harper would be alive,” Dustin Atkinson told the ABC.

Healthscope expressed its “condolences to families involved with the recent instances of failure in patient care”.

Park on Thursday said the government’s review would examine the performance of the operating theatres, but it was rare for hospitals the size of Northern Beaches to have theatres running 24/7.",11,4,Enthingification,https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/northern-beaches-hospital-failing-the-community-audit-finds-20250417-p5lseq.html,2025-04-17 06:28:10,"**Greetings humans.**

The health industry is a scam within a scam on top of a scam.

Since quite a few people here are interested in post-neoliberalism politics, this tragic case of a 'public-private partnership' hospital - set up by the NSW Liberal Party - appears to be a case study in the pitfalls of privatisation.  The hospital has failed its patients on multiple occasions.

Hopefully the NSW Government can determine that that the private operator has breached their contract, and that the hospital should be handed back to the public.

More broadly, these kinds of issues could be a springboard to a demand for better public services.  Public hospitals, public schools, public spaces, public water, etc.

Private enterprise can still have its place, but decent quality common goods are vital.",2025-04-17 06:28:10,False

Parenting,Albanese social media ban,16 year old daughter buying lots of sweets and piling on weight,"Hey guys, not sure what more I can do… i’m worried about her and the weight she is putting on. She works a Saturday and is earning her own money (a 1/3rd goes into her savings) the rest she blows on share packs of sweets/meal deals/mcdonalds. Her school is in a town centre she’s allowed during day and leaves early on a Friday.  She’s never been small but has gone up 3 dress sizes in the last 2 years. 

Things we’ve tried. 

1- talking about healthy eating
2- letting her plan her own lunches (in case she wasn’t getting enough)
3-found out she was eating packed lunch and then buying lunch on top so said we’d buy her lunch out once a week with friends
4-tried discussing buying junk from health perspective (apparently she doesn’t care about health or weight) 
5- making sure she gets plenty of protein at breakfast rather than just carbs
6-tried discussing the amount of receipts I find but she lies says they are off friends (even though I recognise her card number)
7-asked her if she like to join our gym and she was really enthusiastic and has been for last 3 weeks 3 days a week but will only walk slowly on treadmill whilst scrolling social media. Every suggestion to showing her other equipment, getting her a program or trying some resistance training falls on deaf ears. (Not pushing back as just her going is building a healthy habit) 
8- asked her not to waste her money on food when we have loads at home.
9-junk never been banned at home but has always been limited ie 100kcal crisps / chocolate bars

Not sure what else I can do.  In UK if that makes a difference…. I’m just at a loss on how to help if she doesn’t want to help herself…..

I would say this is more related to mental health. I would also suggest that you research binge eating disorder. 

I deal with the same thing, although it was much worse growing up. If she’s feeling judged about what she’s eating then it’ll just cause her to binge in private. 

Also, don’t dismiss any progress that she is making. Just because she isn’t doing what you think she should be doing doesn’t mean she’s not making progress. If she’s going to the gym and walking on the treadmill then that’s a step in the right direction.

ETA: I would also look into the possibility of ADHD as well. She could be eating as a way of seeking out dopamine
---
I don’t think this has been clearly stated yet so here goes. From the perspective of your daughter, you guys only seem to care about her appearance by trying to control what she eats and making her work out. I just know there is something deeper going on- she’s using food as a coping mechanism. Honestly weight and health issues are not strong motivators for a teenager because the danger is so far off.

teenagers,young people and social media ban,Does anyone feel like theres a huge increase in racist and sexist comments on social media platforms lately?,"Even on Reddit too. It’s becoming out of hand. Anytime I see a video of a black person or Asian or Indian it’s full of hateful comments. Especially towards Indians. If I see a video of a woman it’s full of hateful comments. TikTok used to be ok when it came to that stuff but now I see it on TikTok.  Then remember when India and Pakistan were bombing each other and China helped Pakistan? It makes me wonder if the sudden Indian hate was fueled by China….but that’s a hot take. I’m starting to feel like it’s on purpose. Remember when Russia spread false info and created maga on Facebook and people fell for it? I feel like this is the same thing. Create division and tear the country apart. Why does anyone have to bomb countries like the US when they have one of the weakest cybersecurity systems in the developed world? All they have to do is just hire some people or bots to brainwash people and influence them to turn on each other. I mean, at first I was like “why are people protesting about MASKS?!” But then I realized it was maybe because they wanted to get as many people infected as possible. Now I’m reading the comments and I used to get mad, but now I feel like I’m taking the bait and falling into their trap. Maybe it’s not even foreign countries, maybe it’s from people inside the US. I just find it all suspicious…

SocialMedia,age verification social media Australia,It's time to build & nurture a social media community,"The words social media have become synonymous with community in this day and age. Now this gathering of people who follow you could be as close as the next door or as far away as another continent altogether. In this community, you can discuss issues of the highest importance to them, share humorous anecdotes with the ones that deserve the most, or promote what you all believe in. The world has become increasingly digital and community-oriented and so every brand must engage in various social media practices. As a business, it can be hard to get started with social media but the rewards are much greater.

Before you create the social media community it is crucial to make sure that you have clearly defined the objectives of your brand. It could be anything — adding service sign-ups, enhancing product awareness or creating authentic content generated by the users. The goals will depend on the tactics that you employ and the platforms where you choose to create the community. It is also crucial to make sure that these are in alignment with the overall aims of your business. When your brand has a clear identity you connect the best with your audience. However, for this, the identity must also resonate with values that your audience can empathize with!

One of the most effective marketing strategies for social media community building is to select the right channels. As part of your decision, you must think of the preferences and demographics of the target audience along with the overall marketing goals, existing kinds of content on your website, resources available to you, and insights from the social media usage of your competitors. Various platforms cater to different types of content and demographics. For example, Instagram is popular among younger audiences and visually driven while LinkedIn is ideal for B2B (business-to-business marketing) and professional networking. The beauty of platforms such as YouTube is that they offer you the chance for rapid growth and let you put up video content relevant to your business.

Engagement is a logical pivotal step that follows clarification of brand goals and choice of social media platforms for community building. When you are communicating effectively within your social media community it helps you solidify them as sanctuaries for people who are genuinely enthusiastic about your brand. Rather than just using incentives or promotions to start your community you can take hints from the pulse of your community. Listen to what they are discussing, asking, and interacting about. Successful brands always encourage engagement and trust.

Once you have got your social media community up and running it is important for you to be proactive in nurturing it as well. This will make sure that the community is vibrant and relevant. Remember that effective community management never stops — you have to keep on doing it. You can also appoint dedicated moderators to monitor the activities in the community and foster engagement over there. You also need to follow certain steps when you are trying to improve interaction within the community such as beginning discussions on relevant subjects.

If you want to make the social media community grow and succeed it is important that you collaborate. For this, you can bring together your social media marketers and community management team to create a unified experience and message. The social media marketing team can pay attention to metrics like engagement rates and follower count. On the other hand, your community management team can focus on the likes of membership growth, user-generated content, and event sign-ups. However, both will focus on one common area — the number of social media followers converting to becoming community members.

If you activate experts and thought leaders it can and will elevate the appeal and exclusivity of your community. These people would provide you with original insights that will enrich the community. You can always repurpose such insights for platforms such as Twitter and LinkedIn and gain more followers in the process.

If you wish to draw more people to your social media community you have to find out your brand advocates and engage more with them. They are individuals who follow, appreciate, and share your brand’s content ardently. You can offer them exclusive perks like opportunities for beta testing or access to VIP (very important person) events so you can forge deeper connections between your brand and them. You can also promote user-generated content, spotlight loyal customers on your social media platforms, and host community events. All these will help create a sense of appreciation and belonging among your passionate followers.

If you want a thriving social media community you have no other option but to build strong connections as they are the linchpins in this case. So many brands that used to dominate the social media landscape at one point in time fell off the radar because they did not have strong connections with their users. So, if you want to make sure that your community is flourishing you should create strong relationships with your audience and become indispensable to them. For this, in the initial stages of your community, you can adopt proactive engagement strategies.

Apart from these, you must automate your social media strategy to build a strong community in the virtual world. If you want to make sure that your social media community is thriving and engaged you have to be consistent and automated posts on such platforms can be so helpful for you in this particular regard. This way, you can maintain a steady presence even as you offer fresh updates and content to your audience without fail. Not only does this keep your community engaged but it also makes sure that you are using your time on social media optimally as a brand.",10,8,Esigners,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/1i5ku8i/its_time_to_build_nurture_a_social_media_community/,2025-01-20 07:24:50,"If this post [doesn't follow the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/about/rules/), please report it to the mods.

AskParents,kids off social media,Do you post pictures of your children on social media?,"My wife and I have mostly avoided posting pictures of our kid \~2 y/o, since birth.

My wife also posts some photos on her story occasionally because they don't stay up permanently.

We just don't like the idea of photos of our child being plastered all over the internet from the moment they were born. Especially with how AI has been going, we have worries about serious harm that could be done with their photos.

You're justified. We don't post pics. In addition to all of the security concerns related to sharing personal info, Meta now also trains its AI on public content, including photos. There's nothing stopping anyone from taking your content, running it through AI and doing god knows what with it.

Businesses need a SMM who fill save them money and enhance effectiveness by using AI in innovative new ways.  That's the value proposition I've been using, because no business owner wants to feel like they're throwing money away on a social media manager doing stuff AI can do for free.  The new way to be a social media manager is to leverage AI and help businesses get the most out of AI.

I'm also trying to get a job at an agency to gain experience.

Dont. Become a consultant because as a social media marketing agency you are looked as the help instead of an expert.

Collaborating with an international agency can be an excellent strategy to diversify your experience and take on more complex projects. If I were in your situation, I would start by developing a well-structured and presented portfolio, including metrics and concrete results from my previous campaigns.

Allow me to offer one last piece of advice: this transition may take time, so it's important to maintain patience and persistence. Remember that every experience, even rejections, can become a valuable learning opportunity. I wish you the greatest success on this new path.",2024-07-13 13:33:09,False

YouthRights,social media age restriction Australia,"Past moral panics: Tipper Gore, Joe Lieberman and Violent Video Games","This is the one and probably one silver lining to Dubya's ""win"" in 2000. It kept Al Gore's anti-video game team out of office. 

Tipper Gore and Joe Liberman campaigned for laws that required stores to put labels on violent video games, and banned kids from getting violent video games without parental consent. These types of laws were overturned in Brown v Merchant's Entertainment Association in 2011.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/11/us/2000-campaign-vice-president-gore-takes-tough-stand-violent-entertainment.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/11/us/2000-campaign-vice-president-gore-takes-tough-stand-violent-entertainment.html)

Due to how horrible Dubya was, there's kind of an overromantization of Gore's theoretic presidency, and it's mostly forgotten that he was a conservative Southern Democrat with an even more conservative Northern Democrat as his running mate. In fact, Bush and Cheney pretended to be to the left of Gore and Lieberman on half of issues, and one of the few issues where they actually kept their promise on being less conservative than Gore and Lieberman  was on violent video games.

  
But I'll point out a few differences between these video game laws and the new social media laws.

First of all, these video game laws were actually considerably less strict than the new social media laws. The video game laws allowed kids to get violent video games as long as they got parental consent. The social media law in Australia doesn't even allow that.

Second of all, these video game laws actually caused pretty widespread outrage. On the other hand, about 80% of people don't seem to have even heard of these social media laws, and those that have heard of the laws usually seem to support them.

Parenting,kids off social media,"""Wait til 8th Grade"" Phone Movement Was a Miserable Failure","So we live in a small rural community. We sent our kids to a hippy preschool. We know lots of hobby farm liberals, you know, people who went to good colleges and moved back to the land to have chickens and stuff. Everyone in this parent group agreed that they would wait as long as possible until giving their children smartphones. Many spoke of the ""wait til 8th"" movement - a ""pledge empowers parents to rally together to delay giving children a smartphone until at least the end of 8th grade.""

How's it going? My daughter is crying upstairs because she is the only child in 6th grade without a phone and she is dreading a field trip tomorrow because everyone but her will be staring at their phones during the 30-minute bus drive. Lots of these kids had phones in 4th grade.

We're giving up. Buying her a phone for a graduation present. She hasn't really done anything to earn one, nor does she obviously need one. We have a tablet with which she can text and participate in social media at home (but not everywhere she goes). But the peer pressure and FOMO is savage. We're not doing her any favors by continuing to resist. I wish some of our like-minded parents had held off, but they fell like dominoes. ",10,41,Emergency-Bake2416,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1dc8co0/wait_til_8th_grade_phone_movement_was_a_miserable/,2024-06-10 00:13:27,"My advice would be: buy a family phone. It isn’t hers, but she can use it. There is no expectation of privacy on it, because it is a shared phone. It must always be put back in the agreed spot immediately after use (by all family members) because it is shared and it would be unfair to others if they couldn’t find it. Actually use it yourself for some things. 

Think of it as like a replacement for the old copper-wire telephone. By the 8th grade most of us were allowed to call our friends or whatever (although some of us may have had to ask before using the phone). It’s a legitimate gap for kids now. They’re too young for their own phone, but too old to not be allowed *any* independent contact with their friends. 

You might sometimes allow her to take it out of the house (eg for the field trip), but that’s on a case-by-case basis, and with consideration for everyone else in the house who might need the phone that day.
---
Hold out. Seriously. You wouldn't give her a pack of cigarettes because her friends all had them. Get her a flip phone to text you if necessary. She'll be fine.

18 years teaching middle school and now four teaching high school. It's bad out there. Don't let her have social media (autocorrect said 'suicidal media,' dark joke but accurate) til 16 at least.
---
I’m sorry that sucks.  My son is 9 and asks a lot
for a phone.  He’s not getting one any time soon, but I am not looking forward to this next phase.
---
I have a fourth grader and she is the only one of her school friends who does not have a phone.  I follow the wait til 8th movement completely on my own and use their resources. I’m sorry you are dealing with this, it can be so frustrating.  I like the other suggestion about having a family phone.  This is probably the approach we will take. 

Another thing I’ve realized is, it’s not necessarily the phone, but just that my kid wants something to do if her friends have a phone.  She has a switch and a tablet.  That seems to be enough for now in these types of situations.

There are minimalist phones out now. No Internet no social media just call and text, some are on basic phone plans too. Send her with a couple of chapter books, she can read a book on the bus. ",2024-06-10 00:13:27,False

I’m sorry I’m not offering advice but I came here to ask this EXACT question but the other way around haha. 

I’ve heard that it’s worth it professionally to separate accounts because your followers are following your work because it’s specific and it’ll act as a portfolio for your current work. However, it’s very difficult to grow a new account due to the current algorithm and the way things are right now on IG. 

I’m really struggling to grow my new tattoo account and regret making a new one a bit. It’s very difficult to manage two, I’ll say that in full confidence. Following all the tips and tricks for how to produce the correct reel to gain followers / get your work even somewhat visible is way harder than it used to be.
---
Rebrand your current account and with 16.5k followers it’s better to keep them and introduce your new work. Announce the change and update your content....
---
so the biggest question is what would happen to your current account? If it would be inactive my advice would definitely be to try it out and see wat happens. More than realizing it doesn't work can not happen. 

Or the other idea is to switch accounts. If read a comment from a person who said he/she is in the exact same situation the other way around. maybe it would be intreating for both of you to switch accounts or at least work together?
---
My biggest recommendation for this is to YES start a brand new account.

  
IG has been really pushing new accounts and we've tested in with our clients. Making a new account and posting the same video and getting more views/engagement than the old accounts.

  
Another smart way to do this is to make a new account, start posting the new content on there but then collab posting with your old account so you start to get crossover.

Futurology,young people and social media ban,"Envisioning a Post-Scarcity Society: Automation, Meaning, and Resource Allocation","Capitalism, arguably the predominant economic system of our time, is both praised and criticized, depending on individual values and priorities. While it may currently be the most effective system we have, it is not without flaws—particularly the disparities it creates between the elite and the common people. These disparities can, in part, be attributed to two key issues: the relative accessibility to resources and goods, and the exploitation of human labor. Addressing these, among other challenges, could pave the way for a revolutionary new stage of society. The idea of a post-scarcity society, where advanced automation fulfills the needs and many of the wants of all individuals, raises profound questions about human purpose, governance, and resource allocation. By reflecting on these possibilities, we can explore the mechanisms that might underpin such a society and the challenges it would face. Our discussion delves into the societal structure, the role of individuals, and the potential economic frameworks of a post-scarcity world.

The Foundation of a Post-Scarcity Society

A post-scarcity society hinges on ultimate automation. An advanced “machine”—a system of robotics and artificial intelligence—would acquire, transform, and distribute resources uniformly across the population. This would eliminate the need for human labor in essential industries, freeing individuals from the struggle for survival. The baseline needs of every inhabitant—food, shelter, healthcare, and energy—would be guaranteed, allowing people to focus on personal growth, creativity, and relationships.

This vision builds on the current trajectory of AI and robotics, which are advancing at an exponential rate. As industries increasingly automate, many jobs may disappear, outpacing the capacity of current systems to repurpose workers. To mitigate this, tools like Universal Basic Income (UBI) or extended unemployment insurance may bridge the gap, providing individuals with resources while society adjusts to a new economic reality.

Human Nature and the Fear of Meaninglessness

One of the primary concerns about post-scarcity is whether removing the need to work will lead to widespread existential stagnation. Thinkers like Nietzsche and Jung feared that a world without struggle might lack meaning, leading to nihilism. Both recognized the importance of struggle in creating meaning. Nietzsche explicitly warned that avoiding hardship could lead to a complacent, nihilistic state, while Jung’s emphasis on psychological growth through conflict suggests a similar concern about the loss of meaning in a struggle-free existence.However, this concern assumes that struggle is foundational to human purpose, which may not hold true when examining modern examples.

For instance, retirees, a demographic largely freed from the necessity of labor, offer a compelling counterpoint. Once unburdened by the need to work, they do not sink into nihilism but instead pursue meaningful goals, hobbies, and relationships. Unless restricted by health, retirees remain active and engaged, demonstrating that people naturally seek purpose even when freed from economic pressures. This directly challenges the notion that meaning must emerge from struggle; instead, it suggests that meaning stems from intrinsic curiosity, creativity, and the desire for fulfillment.

Further support for this perspective comes from psychology. Many have emphasized that purpose is crucial for mental health, but purpose does not require hardship. While struggles can refine character and inspire growth, they are not the sole source of meaning. Individuals can find profound purpose in creation, exploration, and connection, all of which would be abundantly accessible in a post-scarcity society.

Additionally, human tendencies during vacations provide an intuitive illustration. Extended leisure often leads to boredom after a few weeks, pushing individuals to seek out productive or enriching activities. This behavior reflects an innate drive to pursue challenges and growth, even in the absence of necessity. Rather than spiraling into existential despair, most people gravitate toward activities that offer personal fulfillment.

This is not to say that some individuals won’t face existential difficulties, especially during formative years. Young people, in particular, often struggle to find purpose, and a post-scarcity society would need strong institutions to guide them. Schools, universities, and community organizations would play an essential role in fostering exploration and helping individuals discover their unique paths. These institutions would provide the structure and opportunities needed to counterbalance the existential pitfalls that arise from unlimited freedom.

The Evolution of Education and Cultural Institutions

In a post-scarcity society, institutions focused on economic growth may become obsolete, while others, like schools, universities, museums, and theaters, would remain cornerstones of culture. Education, freed from the constraints of preparing individuals for the job market, could shift toward fostering exploration and creativity. Instead of training students for specific careers, schools could inspire curiosity and innovation, encouraging individuals to delve into the vast array of opportunities that society and the universe have to offer.

By removing economic barriers, a post-scarcity society would allow people to pursue aspirations that were previously impractical due to market constraints. Whether exploring the sciences, arts, or other fields, individuals would no longer be forced to abandon their dreams because of limited demand or financial instability. This unrestrained pursuit of passion would not only enhance personal fulfillment but also drive cultural and intellectual advancement.

Cultural institutions, meanwhile, would play a vital role in preserving and expanding human creativity. The arts, sciences, and humanities would thrive in a world where resources are no longer a limiting factor, ensuring that human ingenuity remains a defining feature of society.

Resource Allocation Beyond the Baseline

While the “machine” provides for basic needs, some institutions or organizations will require resources beyond the baseline—for instance, large-scale scientific research or interstellar exploration. How these resources are allocated will shape the structure of the post-scarcity economy.

One possibility is that the machine accumulates surplus resources in a growing “bank.” Access to these resources could initially involve competition or prioritization through democratic processes, reputation-based systems, or algorithmic management. Over time, as the resource pool grows to effectively infinite levels, competition may diminish. Ambitious projects, such as establishing interstellar colonies, could proceed without significant constraints, enabling humanity to push the boundaries of what is possible.

The Transformation of Capitalism

In a post-scarcity world, traditional capitalism may fade, but elements of it could persist in transformed ways. Markets for essential goods would disappear, as these needs would be universally met. However, niche markets for luxury goods, unique experiences, or cultural artifacts could still exist. The value of goods and services may shift from scarcity to creativity, customization, or emotional significance.

Entrepreneurs might still emerge, driven not by profit but by a passion for innovation and problem-solving. Collaborative efforts, reputation-based economies, and dynamic resource prioritization systems could replace competitive markets, fostering an environment where creativity and collaboration thrive.

Human Flourishing in a Post-Scarcity World

Ultimately, the success of a post-scarcity society depends on how it fosters human flourishing. While automation will transform the economic and social landscape, meaning and purpose will remain central to human existence. Institutions must evolve to support individuals in their pursuit of fulfillment, ensuring that every person has the opportunity to explore their potential.

Far from leading to nihilism, this world could inspire unprecedented levels of creativity, innovation, and happiness. By maintaining cultural cornerstones, enabling boundless exploration, and fostering systems that prioritize collective well-being, a post-scarcity society could unlock a new era of human potential.

In this imagined future, humanity may finally transcend the constraints of scarcity, achieving a society where freedom, meaning, and abundance are available to all.

Conclusion: A Vision Rooted in Optimism and Realism

While the vision of a post-scarcity society described here is undeniably utopian, it is important to acknowledge that achieving it would require a long and complex journey. Transforming our current systems into one where automation meets the needs and aspirations of every individual involves numerous challenges. From technological advancements to ethical considerations, and from the evolution of institutions to addressing the psychological adjustments required in such a society, there are countless hurdles to overcome.

This vision is not a guaranteed endpoint but rather an ideal to strive toward. Each step along the path will demand careful planning, ongoing refinement, and a commitment to addressing the needs of all individuals while preserving the essence of what makes humanity unique. Even so, by imagining this future, we set a direction that prioritizes abundance, equity, and meaning—a foundation for a society where every person has the freedom to pursue their potential.",9,22,Puzzleheaded-Bike529,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1h3onlx/envisioning_a_postscarcity_society_automation/,2024-11-30 22:52:45,"If history is any indication, the ""Haves"" will no longer need the ""Have-Nots"" and will no longer be concerned for their welfare.

Nihilism could be an inevitable future if we as humans don't  address the issue. Our interpretation of meaning or purpose would start to become ambiguous to a point in which it becomes confusing. AI and automation are not the problem, the problem is humans are lacking the attitude to define what purpose and meaning are. People are so distracted from frivolous pleasures that we can't seem to understand ourselves. Don't blame societal norms, blame humans lack of philosophical or profound curiosity.",2024-11-30 22:52:45,False

YouthRights,social media age restriction Australia,Which political faction is best?,"I know lots of youth rights advocates lean left, but the Democrats, on a whole, seem much worse towards youths than the Right. The Right may have problems but the Democrats always push the following:

- Gun laws and gun restrictions on under-21s
- Driving restrictions
- Mandatory schooling
- Cigarette laws

These seem to be the main restrictions they push and that are promoted in general.",9,19,1998Piano,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouthRights/comments/172ey7v/which_political_faction_is_best/,2023-10-07 19:41:17,"My dude, what are you even talking about?

Anarchism
---
The right wing wants to prevent children from learning about sex ed, LGBTQ+ subjects, history, or really anything at all by trying to dismantle free education. They want to indoctrinate children into christianity, coerce them into military service, and exploit them through low-paying, dangerous jobs.

Metaphorically, on average, Democrats want to prevent people from stopping the meat grinder, Republicans are actively pushing people into the meat grinder. Anarchism, as the other comment says, is the correct answer.
---
It causes confusion to approach the issue from a purely parochial perspective of looking only at the politics espoused by current political parties in the USA, and a simplistic contrast of Republican/Democrat, liberal/conservative, and so on.

In any civilised society that's at peace with itself, *nobody* needs to be wandering the streets with military grade assault rifles. Once that's accepted, the question of whether the age requirement to do so is 18 or 21, simply disappears.

Just look at the countries in Europe with left-leaning governments. In most of them, the drinking age is 14 or 16, and the idea of U.S.-style government-imposed curfews on minors would be unthinkable. Some of these countries also have the lowest voting ages, and the youngest elected representatives.

Contrast with the conservative and reactionary theistic regimes in Iran and Afghanistan. They are by their very nature, repressive of the freedoms of *all* age groups.

Right-wing, conservative and theistic governments support patriarchal and repressive policies, and give in to ephebiphobia because it's where their support lies. That's why anarchist and (true) libertarian movements have always been associated with the left, not with the right.

For people who live in the USA and whose only priority is avoiding gun control, voting Republican makes sense. For people whose priorities are wider, it's not so simple.
---
At least in the US, left leaning liberals are best (or at least, less bad). Unlike conservatives, they generally don’t support parental notification/consent for abortions, they generally don’t try to get books banned in schools, they want actual sex ed classes to be taught in schools, they don’t support corporal punishment in school, they generally don’t support forcing schools to out LGBT youths to their potentially abusive parents. Of the minority of politicians in the US who have shown support for lowing the voting age, almost all of them are considered to be quite liberal. Many of the anti youth policies that sometimes get attributed to liberals are bipartisan. Over a decade ago, additional youth driving restrictions (Kyleigh’s Law) in NJ passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. Raising the drinking age was mostly bipartisan. Reagan, who was against big government, went counter to that principal when it came to restricting youth. 

  
Many of the policies that conservatives support that seem to be pro-youth rights will largely run the risk of giving parents additional unchecked authority to harm their children. Republican school choice policies would largely just further help parents to send their children to illegitimate and abusive schools without any regard for the child's wishes or best interest. It would only be if the parents are ok with it, that these policies would allow youth to choose to attend an alternate school more suited to them. It is a real concern that unless policies are put in place first to specifically recognize and protect youth autonomy (which as far as I know, no mainstream American politician wants to do), loosening of child labor laws supported by some conservatives could basically allow parents to enslave their children. As far as libertarians go, I acknowledge that some libertarians support youth rights, but the ones in power are terrible as they see liberty as a parents right to literally own their children (like Rand Paul).",2023-10-07 19:41:17,False

My partners sister (who we don’t really have much involvement with, as she isn’t our cup of tea), once my daughter (8 month old) was born we told her not to post photos of her due to her following and having lots of randoms follow her on social media and on about 3-4 seperate occasions she has posted my daughter knowing we’ve asked her not to post her, and we ask her multiple times each time she post her to take it down, we don’t just ask once and It’s down but still after the first time it shouldn’t have been a problem after that.

Probably best to just not send her pictures anymore
---
Based on your other comments, I hate to say it, but you need to stop sending your child to partner’s mom’s house. You can do that in phases: 
1. Put together a backup. Possibly daycare if you can afford it. 
2. Inform your partner’s mom of this decision since she has proven that she will not control her daughter, that is dependent on her and living in her house. 

Yes, her daughter is a grown woman, but she is living in a house that is not her’s, so your partner’s mom can set rules that she must adhere to or kick her out. If she won’t do that out of respect for how you and your partner want to raise your child, then you must have your back and inform that - without some big changes - you can no longer trust your partner’s mom with your child. 

My LO is 3.5 months old and we are only just now going to trust my mom to babysit in two weeks. My older sister lives with her and only recently got a job. She is prone to not listening to other people, so after months of my mom showing that she will listen to us by only posting photos when we say we can, we are giving she a chance to prove that she will remain in control when babysitting our son. He is the first grandchild, so this is untested territory. 

You have to remain firm and enforce boundaries regardless of how it makes the others involved feel.
---
Next time it happens, send a cease and desists letter. And the next time. And the next time. 

Or comment publicly ‘I haven’t given you permission to post pictures of my child. Take it down now.’ Over and over until she does and her followers start to question her ethics.

Report the photos, sometimes that helps. We have had the same issues with my kids and family members, my oldest is 14 and people are still trying to post photos of him without consent. We minimize access to make it easier to control but there's no perfect system.",2025-01-01 12:14:03,False

teenagers,kids off social media,people don’t care about mentally ill people,"If you notice any weird wording or something like that in this I originally intended to post this on unpopular opinions before realizing this was really an opinion. Also reddit as infected me with their slang words like TLDR so just dont think I didn’t cringe writing that out.

&#x200B;

Whenever the conversation of groups of people that are discriminated against its always the same people brought up. LGBTQ people, People who aren’t christians, black people, hispanics, asians, women, etc. That etc does not include mentally ill people. Those are the most mainstream groups that are discriminated against, and so they refuse to dig deeper into ones that aren’t as easily explained by science and that they can’t personally relate to. They only know depression and anxiety. They don’t think of those as mental illnesses though, because they think they’re just emotions and use depression as general sadness and anxiety as general nervousness. The second they see someone who actually has these they think of them as weird, but then will go around talking about how their anxiety over cooking or whatever. This is an unpopular opinion because these people are not acknowledged. The only people I’ve seen who truly care about mentally ill people are mentally ill people themself. Tiktok and its self diagnosers do not make this any better. Just because tiktok told you that you have ADHD because you vacuum first thing in the morning, or that you have OCD because you have a color coded bookshelf doesn’t mean you have those. Luckily, people are becoming more aware about how stupid those tiktoks are and are starting to make fun of them. People have been saying that ADHD people and Autistic people have started getting better representation and more acceptance, but that is not true. People still would call a person with ADHD a r\*tard if they were to fail a math test because they couldn’t focus, and they would still record an autistic person having a meltdown and caption it something like “Crazy karen hits self and cries publicly 🤣”. Most mental illness self diagnosers are women, but there are men ones too. Specifically schizophrenia. Teenage boys love to self diagnose themself as schizophrenic and name themself stuff like “Based schizo” on social media. Another thing making this worse are those videos you see on youtube titled stuff like “Tiktok is giving people ADHD” and then the “ADHD” just boils down to a low attention span because they don’t actually know what ADHD is. People typically think of old people as the people who hate mentally ill people, but it’s actually everyone who isn’t mentally ill themself. I’ll see comments made by like 15 year olds on videos saying stuff like “They should euthanize that kid 💀” (I saw this in the comments of video of an autistic kid crying on an airplane, the kid being autistic is mentioned in the video also.) Another example is Narcissist being used for anyone who is slightly cocky/arrogant. E.G. “Rebecca said she is pretty today, what a narcissist.” Another example is psycho, and psychopath. People call people acting angry psychos or psychotic (as in psychosis I think? Im pretty sure they think that means psychopath though) or they will call them psychopaths without actually knowing what this means. Sociopath is also used in these situations sometimes. Another example is dyslexia. People will say stuff like “haha I’m so dyslexic I misread what you said.” once again, without knowing what it means. Another example is the misinterpretation of what schizophrenia is. My cousin is schizophrenic and I once told someone that only for them to say “So like he has two personalities?” NO DUMBASS! Most people don’t even know that schizophrenic people have hallucinations and delusions, they also don’t know what psychosis 99% of the time. Second to last, ADHD drug use. People who use Adderall as a party drug are the biggest pieces of shits to exist, they don’t care if they get someone with ADHD fired because they couldnt pickup pills from the pharmacy cause they were stolen, just as long as they get their highschool cocaine. But of course that guy with ADHD can always try a planner instead :) /s.  Finally, OCD. People will claim to have OCD, or be “a little OCD” as usual, not knowing what it means. What they’re actually thinking of is OCPD, but they’re quirky perfectionism isn’t even extreme enough for that. What this all has to do with mentally ill people being ignored in the conversation of discriminated against people is that mainstream media paints mental illness as cute little quirks, or mild annoyances, and not something life ruining like they are. How many people’s lives in modern day have been completely ruined because they’re black or a woman! EXACTLY! All I’m trying to say is if people truly cares for mentally ill people they would educate themselves with even the most basic knowledge of these instead of just thinking “Oh autism, that’s the one where your really smart and can’t tell if people are joking/ that’s the one where they’re “special”/“r\*tarded”.“ I know me saying this will not change anything and you all will just crack little jokes over this. If you are here to make jokes, fuck off. I forgot to mention it, but people are pretty chill if you say you have autism, ADHD, or OCD (mostly because they don’t know what it means.) but it’s still something and that’s good. Also another type of autism self diagnosing people Ive noticed are people who are modern day “trad goths” and “scene kids” You know, the people you see with mlp profile pictures talking about how much they love black kray, them. All of this just makes people with autism seem like little kids making people baby them even more.

TLDR: People simplify life ruining mental illnesses by stigmatizing them, joking about them without understanding them, thinking of them as little quirks, babying the people with them, saying they care about the people with them without actually understanding. etc. All of this resulting in people thinking that mentally ill people don’t struggle that much and that their problems are fixed immediately after medication and then ignoring them and leaving them out of the conversation of discriminated against people.",9,3,coolusername30,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/18t2m38/people_dont_care_about_mentally_ill_people/,2023-12-28 19:43:43,"thanks for writing this. i don't have a mental illness but i grew up with an autistic brother and my best friend has depression, so i guess that's why i relate to this. hell, i was reading books about autism in 6th grade. people can be so damn annoying when it comes to mental illnesses

*Despite promises to end the Coalition’s Cashless Debit Card, Labor has rebranded the welfare payment system that is compulsory in some Indigenous communities.*

By Rick Morton.

A full parliamentary term after promising to end income control, the “suffocating” and “humiliating” policy continues for almost 30,000 people – despite being overwhelmingly rejected in unpublished submissions to the latest consultation over the future of the scheme.

Although the Albanese government began the process of ending the Coalition’s Cashless Debit Card (CDC) early in its term, briefing notes sent within Services Australia in October 2022 requested a $21.5 million tender for the card’s provider, Indue, to “support participants to achieve a minimally disruptive transition to income management”.

Essentially, it was a tender to allow Indue to continue operating a rebadged, compulsory income management program.   

“The agency intends on leveraging the existing CDC technology enabling participants to continue using their cards,” the tender said, “but under a different product name and contract.”

The program continues to grow under Labor, and the Coalition has vowed to bring back the CDC “in communities that want it”.

“They want that card back,” the shadow minister for child protection and Indigenous health services, Kerrynne Liddle, told the ABC in January. “They see a direct correlation, and have experienced the direct correlation, between the card’s removal and what’s happened to them now.”

For political reasons, both the Coalition and Labor speak as if the end of the cashless debit card also spelt the end of income control. The opposite is true.

Under the renamed system that replaced the CDC, known as Enhanced Income Management, there are now 20,007 participants, 79 per cent of whom are Indigenous and all but 4 per cent of whom were forced into the scheme without any say.

In addition to these, a further 11,867 people – 87 per cent of whom are Indigenous – are still on the original version of income management that has been around since the Howard government’s Northern Territory Intervention in 2007.

This system uses an old model BasicsCard that requires a PIN and does not attach to a regular bank account. The CDC and its replacement, the “enhanced” income management, use newer technology that functions like a regular bank card.

Labor has called its version the SmartCard but, like all three iterations, it quarantines between 50 and 90 per cent of welfare funds and is designed to block purchases of products such as alcohol, tobacco, pornography and gift cards or items that can be easily sold for cash, as well as preventing cash withdrawals or spending on gambling.

In establishing new arrangements, Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth introduced two new sets of legislation and corresponding legislative instruments that go further than what the Coalition was able to achieve in its aborted attempt to roll out the CDC universally in the Northern Territory.

These new powers allow any minister to extend income management to any new location without legislation. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights said in 2023 that “the bill and related instruments extend all measures relating to income management to the enhanced income management regime … in effect, the legislation remakes the law relating to income management and possibly expands its scope”.

“People already vulnerable are further exploited as they sell what’s on their card for a lesser cash amount. Those who have previously had financial abuse are subject to further abuse. Money on the card can only be spent in large stores.”

Uniting Communities chief executive and Accountable Income Management Network convenor Simon Schrapel told *The Saturday Paper* the Labor government moved quickly to terminate the CDC when it won the last election but has since expanded the underlying scheme of income control.

“It was a great disappointment, really, because we engaged with the government in those early days and they acted quickly with the legislation to end the Cashless Debit Card and then they put this thing in called Enhanced Income Management, which was really a bit of sleight of hand,” he says.

“We’ve all been duped and we are deeply disappointed. The consultations that have been done have just stalled the process and we’re not entirely sure what is motivating that, whether it’s the bureaucracy that has an issue about wanting to keep this in place or whether there are particular government ministers that are still committed to some form of income management.”

Last year, the parliamentary human rights committee, chaired by Labor MP Josh Burns, recommended social security legislation be amended to explicitly make income management voluntary. This has not happened.

Instead, the Labor government promised yet more consultation into the future of the various schemes. The latest round ended in early December but, unlike other public consultation processes, the Department of Social Services has chosen not to publish submissions received on its website, despite gaining permission from people to do so.

These submissions were eventually disclosed through an order for the production of documents in the Senate and provide insight into what the government has heard about the scheme.

“A flawed, cruel and expensive set of restrictions on people’s economic independence that should never have been drafted, never mind implemented,” one person wrote. “Income management \[IM\] isn’t necessary except in extreme individual circumstances and should never be applied as a blanket measure. This policy has led to evictions due to recipients being unable to reliably pay rent via their income managed card. It has led to people being unable to buy essentials in power or tech failures. It prevents people from participating in legal activities where cash is the only payment method as 20 per cent of an income support payment is very little money to ‘spend freely’.

“I could go on but please, this policy is a punishment directed at vulnerable people who are, by necessity, excellent at balancing a limited budget.”

The cards do not work the way government claims they do. The product-blocking technology that is supposed to identify “forbidden” items at the point of sale is notoriously patchy and the new SmartCards that allow the convenience of tap-and-go payments for individuals are easily exploited.

For those who want to find a way to liquidate their quarantined funds, they do so at a loss.

“I work in youth homelessness services, IM doesn’t work,” one person told the consultation. “People already vulnerable are further exploited as they sell what’s on their card for a lesser cash amount. Those who have previously had financial abuse are subject to further abuse. Money on the card can only be spent in large stores.”

National Regional, Rural, Remote and Very Remote Community Legal Network (4Rs Network) co-convenor Judy Harrison tells *The Saturday Paper* the current system of compulsory income management captures most people based on geographical location, not whether they actually “need” income management.

“So the only way that tens of thousands of people, or any large number, can be warehoused like this on compulsory income management is by mistreating them,” she says.

“There aren’t the resources in the department to do an individual assessment. So that means we can’t have criteria that would require them to be individually assessed, with the onus on the department, because we can’t afford to administer that system.”

As it stands, people can apply to leave compulsory income management but the process is convoluted and the bar for acceptable evidence so high that instances of opt-outs are vanishingly rare.

Harrison said the adult guardianship and trustee system – which can see people with severe mental ill health or other incapacities have their personal or financial affairs managed on their behalf – is legislated and requires a rigorous and reviewable tribunal process before any serious decision like that is made.

“Now compare that with the cashless debit card where people are just put on it – they’re not put on it as individuals, they’re put on as a group and for the high majority it is done geographically,” she said.

“I just find it really remarkable that somehow, the scale of what’s involved in intruding on somebody’s finances hasn’t registered as being a moment, a major human rights and legal event, a major societal event when in other contexts we’ve got all these other checks and balances that don’t always work, but they’re there and we know they’re needed because every one of us, as an individual, has rights.”

Rishworth has requested or received multiple briefings from her department about the future of income management, most notably one summarising every media mention of the abolition of the CDC in 2023 and 2024 – a document that runs to 13 pages.

In another, the talking points anticipate Rishworth being asked about the government’s broken promise to end mandatory income control. The briefing anticipates two questions the minister might be asked on the topic: “Why hasn’t the Government ceased compulsory Income Management yet, as recommended by their own Senators in the Community Affairs References Committee report on the ‘Extent and nature of poverty in Australia’?

“Why do enhanced Income Management legislative instruments operate far beyond when the Government committed to abolishing compulsory Income Management?”

Answering its own question, the suggested response offered to the minister is: “Once consultation is complete and further decisions are made on what the future of the programs looks like, additional legislative changes will be made. This will include reviewing the ongoing requirement for these instruments.”

As a result of this indecision, Simon Schrapel says, the infrastructure for dramatic expansion of income management is in place for any future government.

“Clearly the opposition has a policy position of reinstating the cashless debit card and probably extending it much further in terms of its reach, so leaving the infrastructure and the technology in place makes it a whole lot easier,” he says. “So if there’s a change of government, I think it’s going to be a whole lot easier for an incoming government to ramp things up really rapidly.”

The irony is that Labor made cashless welfare a big feature of its election campaign in 2022 and helped fan the flames of a panic that the Coalition had already drawn up plans to apply income management to age and disability pensioners. This time around, there is little to say.

During a keynote speech at the McKell Institute in Sydney on Tuesday, Rishworth rattled off a roll call of achievements in her first term, including raising the base rate of working-age and student payments by $40 a fortnight but didn’t mention the cashless debit card or its replacement.

When she came to office, Rishworth said, “trust had been shattered between government and community by the robodebt scandal and income support recipients had been demonised”.

In December, the new conservative chief minister of the Northern Territory, Lia Finocchiaro, demanded the federal government “implement 100 per cent income management for parents of youth offenders” as part of her suggested plan to combat crime.

As the Coalition makes its intentions clear, Labor has failed to reaffirm its one-time rejection of compulsory income management.

“We’ve been trying to get a sense of, well, what’s next?” Schrapel says. “They know what the opposition have said and there is a chance for the government to actually differentiate. We do need to actually get an answer.

“Are they prepared to come out before May 3 and actually say, ‘We will, in the first 12 months of being re-elected, ensure that there is no form of compulsory income management in Australia again?’ Or will they do another three years of consultation? They won’t say what their plan actually is.”

A campaign spokesperson answered on behalf of Rishworth and Minister for Indigenous Australians Malarndirri McCarthy.

“The Albanese Labor Government committed at the last election to abolish the Cashless Debit Card and to make it voluntary in those communities through the SmartCard. We have delivered on this commitment,” the spokesperson said. “We’re delivering a long-term plan to reform income management, which has been in place since 2007, and are committed to working through this matter in partnership with the communities that would be affected by any changes.”

Mmm we'll have an Indigenous Voice to Parliament, not adequately support marginal communities facing incredible racism while concurrently not allowing you to spend your income. 

Albo said in the debate that he wants to see First Nations livelihoods improve, how is this an improvement?

After giving the cards, would they be forced to spend all the money or would they be allowed to save money without getting a cut?

AustralianPolitics,Australia digital ID law,Exploring Australia: The Issues That Transcend Culture Wars,"Australia’s fixation on so-called woke culture, immigration, and fears of rising crime is diverting attention from a serious foreign policy crisis. The federal government continues to deepen military ties with the United States, granting American forces unrestricted access to Australian bases. These arrangements place Australia on a collision course with nuclear-armed adversaries. It is no longer speculation that in any conflict targeting U.S. global power projection, Australia would stand exposed to direct retaliation.

Leaders in Canberra have pledged unwavering support for American actions against major powers. This has resulted in being listed among hostile nations by Russia and has reinforced a confrontational approach toward China, Australia’s primary trade partner. Policies that simultaneously demand China’s commerce while labeling it a strategic enemy create a dangerous contradiction. Major regional neighbors such as Indonesia and Malaysia are forging stronger links with alternative blocs and may not stand alongside Australia in a conflict.

The United States has signaled that it prefers proxy wars when facing nuclear-armed opponents. Australia’s integration of its armed forces with the U.S. military indicates readiness for engagement on Washington’s behalf. This approach does not increase Australian security. It brings the threat of nuclear or large-scale retaliatory strikes onto Australian territory, without offering any guarantee of U.S. intervention to save lives here.

While Canberra speaks of upholding a “rules-based order,” the United States regularly bypasses international law. Australia joins these breaches instead of asserting independence. The nation ignores shifting global power structures where China, Russia, and other major economies collaborate through BRICS and similar forums. Countries to Australia’s north are seizing growth opportunities by cooperating with these emerging blocs. Australia’s refusal to explore genuine partnership with regional neighbors may isolate us if conflict erupts in the Asia-Pacific.

Sovereignty depends on regaining control of financial, economic, and defense decisions. A publicly owned national bank, separate from private and foreign-owned systems, would allow Australia to invest in its own infrastructure and industries. That level of independence is crucial when foreign powers can cut off credit or digital systems. Elections offer a moment to consider alternatives to a two-party establishment that consistently upholds foreign priorities over genuine Australian interests. A third political force could advance policies that prevent Australia from being dragged into wars that serve external agendas.

This is not a warning about vague or distant problems. Threats from nuclear-armed states have already materialized, and nothing in current defense policy deflects them. Urgent change is needed to protect Australian territory, economy, and sovereignty. It begins by rejecting distractions, examining the alliance with the United States more critically, and developing a strategy that secures Australia’s future without sacrificing it for battles we did not choose.",9,84,Maleficent-Host-8975,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/1i4jeid/exploring_australia_the_issues_that_transcend/,2025-01-18 22:38:15,"I love how these posts always argue how we should distance ourselves from our allies to get closer to China, and then claim that China would hypothetically drop nukes on us if we don't, and then *blame Australia and the USA for China dropping nukes on us*.

>This has resulted in being listed among hostile nations by Russia 

Pretty sure that was us giving weapons to the Ukrainians 

>and has reinforced a confrontational approach toward China, Australia’s primary trade partner. 

The current government have significantly reversed the antagonistic approach of the previous government and that has resulted in the removal of barriers to trade and a resumption of diplomatic interaction. 

>Policies that simultaneously demand China’s commerce while labeling it a strategic enemy create a dangerous contradiction. 

They also provide us a good position to help negotiate and maintain peaceful interaction between our largest trade partner and our largest defence partner

>Major regional neighbors such as Indonesia and Malaysia are forging stronger links with alternative blocs and may not stand alongside Australia in a conflic

Australia has formal strategic partnerships with both Indonesia and Malaysia

>While Canberra speaks of upholding a “rules-based order,” the United States regularly bypasses international law

The thing people seem to miss from the “rules-based order,” is that its actually the ""american rules-based order"", and its more of a guideline than a rule. Its literally the attempt to internationalise diplomatic conflict resolution, its not some hard and fast law and its not going to work a lot of the time, its about trying to do better and arguably the last 70 years have been far more peaceful than any other time. Its simplistic to act like international law is fully established and normalised.
---
Honestly always found hand-wringing over nuclear annihilation to be quite the pathetic reason for any preceeding argument.
---
It just seems a bit farfetched to me, the idea that China would be completely benevolent to us if they were successful in isolating us from our most important and capable ally.

The idea of someone asking their real estate agent to settle a petty housemate dispute has made my day. No, do not email your property manager asking “Can you please tell my housemate to stop pissing on the toilet seat :(“ Or actually maybe do it and post the reply because that would be pretty funny.

This guy sounds like a really annoying person to live with, I get that, but you can either solve it by talking to him or you can’t. Try asking him again. If he can’t keep his piss off the seat, you’ve got three options: 1) Move. 2) Get a new housemate. 3) Wipe it off with toilet paper yourself until you can do option 1 or 2.

Get a sign for the bottom of the toilet lid that says “if you sprinkle while you tinkle be a sweetie and wipe the seatie” and then put one of those toilet training targets on the back of the bowl.

YouthRights,Australia under 16 social media ban,Censorship on social media,"You probably all recognize me as Sarah Li from Quora (born 1987). The reason why my previous account was shut down was because I advised against using ADHD medication on the ADHD sub, which got me banned, but days later, my account was permanently suspended. 

Not sure why. I imagine that most people on this sub share my sentiments about Youth Rights and my aversion towards mental health labels all-too-often slapped on young people such as ADHD. 

I am averse to ADHD drugs in general because I know many children who took them and it took away their appetite and prevented them from sleeping. This is horrible! Who would do that to a child?

But Quora has also banned/censored me multiple times for my posts, in the name of fighting exploitation. My only crime? Stating that adulthood begins when puberty ends, which is really mid-late teens (or even age 14 or so for women). 

Years ago, when I started using Quora, I was able to freely say all this. But now, my answers keep getting deleted in the name of fighting exploitation. The same goes for other social media outlets.

It seems that this censorship is getting pretty bad! Another reason to oppose infantilization! Because if they raise the legal age, the next thing you know, if you advocate for treating 20-year-olds as adults (saying that 20-year-old women are old enough to become mothers), you will get censored.

Why all this censorship? Same for FB and many outlets.

I was in almost this same exact situation as you a few years ago. I just turned 17 but I dropped out of school at 15. Because of my crippling social anxiety😁.Thought my life was over. Also had no friends. Found out I can get my diploma by graduating if I passed a ged exam. Took a lot of studying, I barley started my sophomore year when I left school. But I passed while thinking I was the dumbest human being to exist. Anyway fast forward to now. I’m currently enrolled in my local community college. I actually have goals! I’ve always wanted to work with animals so that’s what I’m working towards. I’m building enough credits to get an associates degree. From there I can go to any university I’d wish. Well not any but if my transcripts or good enough who knows. Basically I have zero highschool transcripts cause I’ve never finished a grade fully. So if I want to go to a better college I have to do this. And that’s okay! What I’m trying to say is that you’re going to be okay. Your life doesn’t end here. The last year and a half has been hell for me. But I’m actually going places now. Don’t give up. I’m 17 now but if I could tell my 15 year old self this I would.

Then, find out who your federal member is. They'll have a similar contact page. Find out where their office is and you can also go in there.

- Figure out your electorate and your local MP: https://electorate.aec.gov.au
- Contact your local MP about your concerns. 

You can do this by going to their page on the Parliament of Australia website. Scroll down to the ‘Connect’ tab and select the ‘Contact Form’.
---
So you are represented in three different levels of government:

Local level: The councillors representing you ward in your local council.
Contact them for issues re: bins and rubbish, pets, local public facilities, vegetation, road safety and signage, street lights, parks and libraries.

State: Your local MP in the lower house, and in most states, some form of representation in the upper house.
Contact them for issues re: Education, health, emergency services, infrastructure, public tansport, power, environment, industry, housing, etc.

Federal: Your local MP in the house of representatives, and 12 senators in the senate.
Contact them re: Immigration, defence, taxation, foreign affairs, trade, post, banking, etc.

If you look up your suburb or town on wikipedia, it should tell you your local state and federal electoral division in the infobox on the right hand side. Find out who represents that electorate, and send their office an email, letter, or phone call. Your local council's website should have a map of the wards and councillors.",2024-11-18 06:30:17,False
AskParents,Australia under 16 social media ban,I 24f have come to the realization that I have majorly messed up. Can someone offer advice?,"So, I 24f have Inattentive ADHD and Autism level 1. I don't know how important this is for anyone giving advice but felt like I should add it just in case. Anyways I have been living with my older sister and Brother-in-law since August of 2022. For almost three years now they have been trying to help me become a responsible and independent adult. I will admit that I did not want to do what they wanted me to do. I have been lying to myself and telling myself that my situation was fine. I preferred to live in my own imagination/daydream of wanted I wanted to believe my life was. I knew I wasn't in a good place financially, but I just chose to ignore the truth because I didn't want to face it. 

This is a list of things they have asked me to stop doing/work on:

1. Being Sneaky (Hiding food and hiding what I am doing on my phone) I would buy snacks and drinks with money I didn't have

2. Being Impulsive - I have ADHD and can be impulsive. I don't think through my decisions fully. I would spend money on random amazon packages or ordering food instead of saving money

3. Not making realistic goals - I would make goals like saving $30,000 by the time I'm 30 when I'm currently barely making $2,000 a month right now

4. Not making good financial decisions - Goes back into the impulsive one. I have been spending money instead of saving money

5. Running instead of confronting problems - I have really bad anxiety, and I didn't want to confront the fact that I have just been immature and dumb to be honest

6. Getting defensive to the point of crying during talks - I would get defensive and angry (I cry when I get myself worked up) because I knew I wasn't doing what I should be doing I just didn't see it that way

7. Use time management - Once again ADHD I struggle with time management, but I have been actively working on this one. I start to get ready an hour before work and I have just forced myself to start working on chores, so they are done on time 

8. Setting Priorities - This one I would spend money on wants instead of my bills. 

9. No phone when talking - I had a really bad phone addiction where I would be on it almost 24/7. I have been working on this issue. 

10. Using logical thinking - Again partly because of ADHD. I will act first think second if that makes any sense. I would realize afterwards like hey that wasn't a very good idea. But then I would tell myself ""It's okay"" or ""it's not a big deal; it will be fine""

11. Not hyper fixating on YouTube or TikTok - This one I have fought them really hard on. I listen to music a lot, so I believed I needed access to YouTube. TikTok just became super addictive to me. I now just use Spotify to listen to music and podcasts. 

12. Forgetting my responsibilities - This one ties back into the YouTube and TikTok one I would hyperfocus on social media and had trouble putting my phone down. 

13. Being accepting of the word no - This one I would get upset mainly because it wasn't what I expected in my head, and I would get upset by it. I don't feel like it was because I was simply being told no I think it was more that I would become upset because things didn't go the way I expected them to. Which I am going to be working on. 

14. Working on taking constructive criticism without emotionally shutting down - I think this one ties into the getting defensive one. I wasn't being told what I wanted to hear. I didn't want to hear that I'm not doing or acting appropriately for my age. I was in denial. 

15. Losing Things - Okay this one is major ADHD. I have a problem with setting something down and then a second later forgetting where I had put it down. I do have a solution for this I have a plan to get an air tag to put on my keys so I can track it if I lose it. I also have a wallet with a keyring on it so I only need to keep track of my wallet because wherever my wallet it my key will be with it. 

16. Being on my phone less - This one I have a strategy for working on this one. I have started to set a timer on my phone for 8 hours so the rule for myself is as long as the timer is going, I cannot use my phone. Its eight hours in total because I use Uber to get to work or if my sister/BIL try to get into contact with me I have to pick up my phone. 

I have asked my sister if I could sit and talk to her about all of this. I don't know what has changed. I don't know if it's my 25th birthday coming up, but it's like I had a come to Jesus' moment that my sister has been talking about. I have begun journaling recently and I have been reflecting on how I have been behaving. Even making this post looking at I feel like this isn't the behavior of someone in their 20's it's the behavior of a teenager. So, any advice anyone can give on this. I guess the advice I'm looking for is if I was your sister or kid would you allow me to make up for what I have done? I plan to ask my sister and BIL for forgiveness. And to ask what I can do to gain their trust back. Thanks",8,12,KindMud5060,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskParents/comments/1jv7pwk/i_24f_have_come_to_the_realization_that_i_have/,2025-04-09 14:53:36,"Thank you u/KindMud5060 for posting on r/AskParents.

Good for you.  Recognizing and investing time to make yourself better is the first step.

You seem to have a good start.  Only thing I would add is don't overdo it!  16 things is a lot to track of.  Stack-rank the most important and what will make the biggest changes, focus on that 1 or 3 things, knock it off of the list, and that will make everything more manageable.  And if you slip up here and there on a less important thing, that's ok.  It's important to get up and keep going.
---
My first question is, how much older are they than you?

Looking back at my life, I didn't start actually figuring out a lot of those things until between 23 to 25. I feel I may have been very similar. It was a difficult process, but having a good therapist who was able to call me out on shit while also not leaving me feeling like I made them angry or they were going to punish me somehow, makes a huge difference. 

Also, this is an explanation, not an excuse — your brain/impulsivity control development is not fully until closer to 26 for neurotypical people. Neurodivergence adds a couple of years delay. 

So what that means, is finding the resources and learning to work with your brain, and working significantly harder to bring yourself to the mental headspace you desire and know exists and that you would like to be like. 

Using your Neurodivergence to explain where you are is different from using it as an excuse. Because using it as an excuse is ""I'm Autistic/ ADHD, so this is the best I am capable of."" Using it as an explanation is ""this is why I struggled with these areas. But now that it's been brought to my attention and I'm more aware of it,  I would like to work hard to do better than I've been doing to this point.""

Hope that helps a little bit.

My daughter was diagnosed with exactly the same things as you, so I’ve seen this, although she a bit younger. 
Nothing they are asking is unreasonable, it’s part of being an adult.  They seem to have themselves together so using them as your example isn’t a bad idea.   Talk to her maybe you can tackle a couple of these at a time, all at once does seem a bit tricky.  But I would listen to them if I were you
---
I'm proud of you. I know from experience that this is a difficult thing to reflect on.

The air tags idea and timer on your phone sound like a great place to start. The small goals help build up to the larger overall goals. Add to the smaller goals in steps. If writing down a list of things to accomplish daily helps then you should do it. I am 50 and make a list to help me remember what needs to happen daily (chores, appointments, what is for dinner and who is making it). Remind yourself that you are human and none of us are perfect.

Allow yourself the grace to forgive yourself. The internal workings of our bodies are not easily changed, but you see that changes can happen.

Your sister and brother-in-law sound as if they have been a good support for you.

SocialMedia,Australia under 16 social media ban,How I view social media + Best practices for social in 2024,"# 1. Here’s my simple theory about brand social media

1/ If you are an established brand, your biggest goal should be to make people share their stories, because everyone loves to self-express their stories. If they aren’t you have an audience representation problem or you aren’t giving them right tools/prompts. A brand targets socialisation to make sure audience creates organic media.

2/ If you are a new business, your biggest goal should be to make people listen, you need to be media first, be the entertainer and show the talent. Once you do that, your potential audience will be attracted and then you need to show association with a product, like an event highlights their sponsor. That way your audience treats everything as a natural occurring, the media face will end after a while, socialisation begins.Now, when brands & marketers treat social media as a job, they are too obsessed with this idea of being in a systemic growth loop. That they slowly phase out either socialisation or media, and sometimes they are too obsessed with data and exposure. Please stop doing that, the main question behind creating for a social media audience always remains; ***Are we socialisation (like at a party) or sharing media (like a movie gathering) through our content?***

# 2. Brands need to create Jokes, not memes.

When Internet was less saturated, Memes meant something. People had the time and context to connect with Memes and brands making them. I mean that’s the true definition of a meme, it’s a medium used by people to critique and highlight different messages. My definition might seem like corporate jargon, but memes in Internet culture don’t exist for brands to slap their products and business. We indirectly share truth and flaws of our society through memes.What brands need are Jokes because they require minimum context and last forever or long-enough.Another factor, Trending Memes ask more from viewer than they ask from you. Put yourself in your customer’s shoes. Memes require more context and better timing if they aren’t chronically online.

At the end, I would say using trending memes isn’t wrong but the best thing you can do is making jokes that are true to your brand, because they are funny and last forever.

# 3. Algorithms slowly change us, care about them.

When marketers talk about algorithm, they don’t get the idea of creating for algorithm vs audience is similar to this idea of what came first, Egg or Chicken? My answer is simple, don’t dwell on the past.

1. If you care about Brand Awareness → Create for Discovery Algorithms → For that, Create content focused on internet culture and creativity. (Originality & Creative over everything)
2. If you care about Brand Identity or Customer Engagement → Create for network algorithm → For that, create customer-focused content & build a distribution network.
3. If you care about Brand Growth &Conversions → Create for Search Algorithm → For that, focus on social listening, conversational content and engage in active communities

If you are thinking, Didn’t I mention in the beginning to not treat social media as a job? And now, he’s telling us to create for algorithm. In the beginning, I meant that from a creative point of view, now I am trying to share how distribution of content happens through algorithms and how it transforms the consumer.

# 4. Contextual Value isn’t everything, Convenience is.

In 2024, The medium defines how much people value the content. But don’t get carried away by your idea of a better medium, many marketers start spending the budget on expensive production.If you had a great conversation on a podcast, turning that into a clip and posting on TikTok & Instagram isn’t enough. You need a header & Closed Captions because most users have music turned off or low while watching content.Same with Youtube, Are you planning to post your webinar or workshop? Most viewers are influenced by the visuals from auto-play, meaning you need to perfect the the first-impressions and your Intro is like a trailer to your video.

# 5.Rise of curation & schizophrenic usage

I was curating social media content way before everyone started as I was forgetting influencers and how different pieces of content connected. Nowadays everyone I know says they can’t recall most of the content they watch, and influencers come and disappear from their feeds.Curation is an important part of social media and it exists for users to recollect and develop their thoughts about content and influencers they love.***Introducing ‘Brand Pause’ an initial part of Curation and Creation culture.*** Have your thought about giving your audience time to reflect on your content? Even though your audience knows the need to pause to reflect but they need reminders. By the way, We just saw a version of Brand Pause in form of 2023 recaps, everyone shared them. These recaps are built on idea of curation and reflections.

&#x200B;

# 6. I want to normalise deleting or turning off comments

Everything on social media is a piece of content, I think I shared this message before with you. Did I? Nonetheless if you are a honest brand (it’s rare) or creator, You shouldn’t fear to delete the comments. Because you are trying to communicate something through the content and comments can change the context of your message.I mean imagine if a museum had comments section, will anyone ever build their own unfiltered perspective? I find that hard to imagine. An argument I got about deleting comments was the right to correct someone, if a brand is doing something wrong, the backlash starts at not liking the content. I am imagining you don’t work for a brand like that, do you? Nah.

# 7. A non-marketing perspective on social media

I believe social media was never social, we make it sociable and we erase that part when we want. We know the stories of social media founders, it’s hard to believe these were people trying to socialise in a way we define social. What happened was those who socialised gave people a reason to speak and that’s the beauty of social. If people aren’t confident to share and speak, we have a problem.From the beginning, Social media has been performative, that’s why we talk about that culture on social. Social gave people a way to hide their weaknesses and truth to portray a perfect picture. That use of anonymity still exists and it changes behaviour of people, the reason why you see reddit users as harsh and TikTok users as kids.The dark side of social media is every platform grew to become home of brands and Ads. Users never had a problem with that, everyone knew it was coming. But the founders of social media were neither creative nor socialised enough to build an ecosystem that awards marketers the freedom of audience research and creative. Because of that, marketers spend more time fixing errors and studying changes in Ads managers.The performative culture awarded influencers as they became representers of different lifestyles and entertainers for the users. Then, influencers were awarded by marketers as they found a better and natural way of marketing. From that day forward, we have only seen growth of performative culture and influencer bubble. Many are now building new cultures as they outgrew the performative identities and few are waiting the bubble to burst.And the platforms are doing early planning to replace influencers with AI, while brands lose their identities in a fast space by following each other, instead of building their own culture. At the moment, we have achieved a messy point, the solution costs the social media apps money, the only one stopping the apps is Europe trying to ban algorithm and endless scrolling.

The ads on scrolling my own feed on facebook already turned me off the app, haven't used it in days anytime I do > I close the app down on the first countdown to an ad. Especially if it comes like an ""ad break"" while literally watching an ad video....... so stupid. 

Same with instagram... it paused for an ad-break while watching an AD for a book... like... 

Making ads have ad-breaks is just a dumbass stupid Way to kill your own platforms... and then thry have the NERVE to ask us to pay for it to be removed so we can watch the same amount of spamlevel usual ads like before......

privacy,young people and social media ban,Consumer Behavior and the growth of Social Media,"I just had an interesting conversation with chatgpt, based really on that interesting comment in the redact rant post.

That social media content never gets deleted, it only gets made invisible.

I asked what forces could be applied that would be effective at just eliminating social media.

I like and use social media to some extant, aka I am here on Reddit, but its clear to society at large it has some real deletorious effects on us, how we relate to people, our ability to be kind, and develop friendships and relationships.

The key is then what can be done, to fix or improve social media.

It is clear as long as the money is there, social media will encourage us users to create accounts and post content, which they will use to sell ads, services, and our data.

If it is free, then we are the product.

Do we really want to change the financial situation to paying for social media, to give ourselves more control, is there any chance we can wean ourselves off of it.

Some of us do.

Clearly consumer behavior doesn't have the wisdom to understand how social media in the long run is wrecking our lives.

So the social media companies keep making more and more money.

I also asked it is there any chance the social media companies are financially behind all the social media deleter companies, so as to create pr for them if they are found out how much of our personal data they have and sell?

It said it was very likely.

So where does that leave the privacy community.

What is our goals related to social media, and what do we want to do about it economically?

privacy,Online Safety Amendment Act 2024,The Retail Equation and the Creation of Your Consumer Risk Score,"Seems harmless enough - you are an honest consumer and you want to return an item that you legitimately purchased at a store and have a receipt. The clerk asks you for your State issued State ID - namely Driver's Licence. They want to scan the barcode on the back into the computer.

1) That barcode contains your name, address, birth date, height, weight, hair color, eye color, gender, marital status, ethnicity, city of birth, and many more fields of personal information on you.

2) The information is sent to The Retail Equation who builds a database on you resulting in a Consumer Risk Score. Much of this operation occurs outside of the US.

3) A store using the TRE system will either allow or deny the return even with a receipt based on your Consumer Risk Score. Many people have been falsely flagged by this system and have been banned from making a return to any of the 27,000 plus participating stores for one year, whether they have a receipt or not. Some have even claimed that online order have been banned.

Things like this happen slow, and some will say it is a conspiracy - but this is really happening and spreading. This is too much information to give to a foreign based company to form what seems to be a form of a Social Credit Score. On June 21, 2024 I bought a $20 tool at Harbor Freight that was defective. On June 27, 2024 I went to the store with the receipt to return it and get a refund. The store refused to give me a refund when I refused to let them scan my Driver's License. The Store employees acted like I was silly for not letting the scan my DL. Most people do not understand what information is in the barcode and that they should never give anyone that information. I ate the $20 and will never do business with that company again.

If this happens, file a chargeback. They have no reason - and in most places with decent privacy laws, no right - to demand ID for a refund.

This goes for *everyone* affected by this. If enough people file chargebacks this policy will disappear very quickly.

I agree that by scanning IDs they can collect way too much personal information. Return fraud is a real thing, but why not simply ask for the phone number as many stores did befor TRE came along?

If you have to use them, you can use other types of government ID that contain less information, e.g. passport cards.

Also, I don't think they are ""foreign based"", although it is of course possible that they outsource some of their operations.

For those of you still reading this Thread on The Retail Equation.

4) THE RETAIL EQUATION or The Store(retailer) CAN'T DO ANYTHING about the Credit Card Dispute -- Because you made a good faith effort to Return the Merchandise - within the Return Period. 
5) Then stay away from the Store (the retailer) and buy the future merchandise from Another Store.

And I feel as though I am to the age where I deserve leeway to grow. I’m unable to google anything, call or text friends etc. 

I personally feel that I’m at the age where my mom shouldn’t be going through the school directory to make sure that the people I want to talk to actually are who I say. I also think that it’s genuinely problematic. I needed to call a local community college to set up a test recently.. I couldn’t. My mom got mad at ME for not being on top of it. What do you mean? I physically can’t call the school when you prevent me from calling anyone. 

My mom barely approved contacts, so I am pretty isolated from my friends and some parts of my family if mom seems them a “bad influence”. I think that if I’m to the age where I have my license, I should be able to google a definition or play roblox without having to send a request that she never approves and when she does it’s for an hour.

I shouldn’t need to ask my mom to add numbers before a friend can take me home from practice. 

I guess I’m so mad at this because my siblings don’t have any restrictions (one is my twin) and I want a social life. I want to be able to talk to boys in a romantic way (people in my class) without my mom needing an exact reason why I want to talk to them because i want privacy..

Is there a reason she imposes these restrictions on you, specifically? If your twin has more freedom to contact whoever, then it sounds like there’s a backstory. 

Anyway, it sucks to not have all the same privileges as many of your peers at school, but not every 16 year old has a cell phone, and virtually every generation of human beings in history before this one wasn’t giving their 16 year olds cell phones, so hopefully you can also survive for another year or two. Just talk to people in person, or over email - if possible. I mean, I sympathize with you, but if you’re mainly hoping for greater access to secret conversations where you can be romantic with boys, then I may see where your mom feels like a double standard is justified here.
---
In highschool I started off verifying everything, then as they proved themselves I kept taking a step back.  Gradual entrance to adulthood.

The fact your twin has more freedom tells me perhaps she has the same approach, and you haven't proven you are trustworthy?  Or is your twin a male, and your family is that kind of family?

PS, dating at 16 is a waste of time and a distraction from achievement.  Set yourself up for an independent life first, THEN share it with someone.

I'm really sorry you're dealing with this. It sounds like you're feeling very isolated, and that there are a lot of double standards between you and your twin. I don't know enough about your mom to give suggestions on how to approach her. But I do think when you finally get to college you'll have more freedom to grow and be who you want to be and be with the people you want to be. You deserve to be given the tools to properly judge character now before you're off on your own, instead of being barred from talking to anyone. Your mom is by definition a helicopter parent. Many kids who grow up this way end up going wild in their college years because they finally get freedom. Just be sure when you're finally on your own to stay safe and not get too crazy (not saying you will, that's just what happened to me when I finally got freedom)

AustralianPolitics,Online Safety Amendment Act 2024,Exclusive: The lost childhood of Khan Ali Safdary,"The UN has ordered that Australia compensate the Afghan refugee who, having arrived as an unaccompanied child, endured more than seven years of detention.

By Dr Saba Vasefi.

National and international human rights bodies have found that Australia violated the rights of Khan Ali Safdary, an Afghan refugee who arrived in 2011 as an unaccompanied child.

Khan Ali – a member of the systematically persecuted Hazara minority – was unable to pursue legal redress in an Australian court due to this country’s lack of federal human rights legislation.

Now 31, he has endured multiple forms of confinement, including more than seven years in closed detention centres across several states, as well as time in mental health institutions. In 2017, he suffered life-altering harm during his detention on Christmas Island.

“I’ve been to places where officials say human rights are a Western idea and deny them. But none treated me as cruelly as Australia,” Khan Ali tells The Saturday Paper.

“I wrote dozens of complaints to the government, but each was denied,” he says. “As a survivor of war, genocide and one of the most punitive and inhumane immigration systems in the democratic world, I want to understand how those meant to uphold the law can become its violators?”

On April 28, six years after Khan Ali submitted his case to the United Nations Human Rights Committee – under the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights – it has censured Australia for his arbitrary detention and the insecure conditions of his confinement.

The committee found that the prolonged nature of Khan Ali’s detention was “unreasonable, unnecessary, and disproportionate” to any legitimate policy objective. It determined that Australia violated his rights by denying him meaningful judicial review of his detention and by subjecting him to conditions that inflicted grave psychological harm.

The UN has ordered that Australia provide Khan Ali with appropriate medical rehabilitation and compensation, respond within 180 days detailing how it will implement the ruling, and widely disseminate the findings.

“I want justice,” Khan Ali says in Dari. “My case should be assessed under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, not the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.”

Alison Battisson, principal lawyer at Human Rights for All, who represented Khan Ali’s case at the UN, says Australia’s treatment of refugees in its detention regime – both onshore and offshore – and its refusal to provide permanent safety to certain groups of refugees, go against the core principles of the UN foundational documents and the Refugee Convention.

“I’ve been to places where officials say human rights are a Western idea and deny them. But none treated me as cruelly as Australia.” “It makes a mockery of Australia’s membership of the UN and signatory to the main human rights conventions,” Battisson says.

Khan Ali was a child when his brother was killed in Afghanistan’s internal conflict, and he saw his brother’s bloodied corpse, bearing a gunshot wound to the head.

At 14, Khan Ali walked, took public transport and hitchhiked from Pakistan through Iran and Turkey, eventually reaching Greece. Facing deportation, he hid in a truck to Italy, then took a train to Austria, where authorities detained him for deportation to Greece.

In Austria, the UN Refugee Agency helped Khan Ali to obtain a temporary visa as a minor.

After learning of his father’s murder in Pakistan, he flew to Australia in October 2011 to reunite with his siblings. Upon arrival, at age 17, the government did not recognise his status as a child.

The immigration department used wrist X-rays that are considered “discredited age verification techniques” to classify him as an adult, which led to more than seven months in adult detention at New South Wales’s Villawood Immigration Detention Centre.

Khan Ali was released on a bridging visa in 2011 but redetained in 2012 after his protection visa was rejected. Denied another bridging visa in 2013, he spent six years in other detention centres, moving from Western Australia’s Yongah Hill to the highest-risk jail on Christmas Island in 2016.

There, Khan Ali endured a serious assault. Before being taken to hospital, he was placed in solitary confinement.

The Western Australian District Court could not directly determine whether the harm constituted a breach of his human rights. However, it described his “vicious beating”, resulting in injuries that included a fractured eye socket, tinnitus, permanent hearing loss, chronic head pain and double vision.

The attack occurred after authorities housed violent offenders alongside vulnerable asylum seekers. The court lacked jurisdiction to assess whether this amounted to inhuman or degrading treatment while in state custody.

In response to his complaint against the Commonwealth of Australia, in particular the Department of Home Affairs and detention centre operators Serco Australia, the Australian Human Rights Commission issued a report that was tabled in parliament and submitted to the attorney-general.

The report attributed the assault to the Commonwealth’s unjustified classification of Khan Ali as a “high-risk” detainee.

Khan Ali was treated at Christmas Island before being flown to Royal Perth Hospital, then transferred to Perth Immigration Detention Centre. According to the Human Rights Commission, Serco guards used excessive force to move him back to Yongah Hill, including handcuffs, a body belt, and kicking him post-surgery while another officer restrained his head.

The commission contradicted the accounts of the centre’s operations manager and five other officers that Khan Ali posed a threat.

Khan Ali says he was also repeatedly denied access to his full medical records. “I still haven’t seen the X-ray of my fractured eye socket,” he says. “Instead of protection, I was punished. There was no explanation. This wasn’t treatment – it was trauma.”

In a letter responding to the Human Rights Commission, a Home Affairs official said the department does not accept the finding that Khan Ali’s detention from February 2017 was arbitrary, maintaining it was justified based on his circumstances.

The department delayed referring Khan Ali’s case for release consideration in 2014, 2017 and 2018, leading to more than five years of continuous detention before ministerial consideration. He was granted a Safe Haven Enterprise Visa in 2021, permitting him to get a job and to study. Two years later, he received a visa to stay in Australia permanently.

Also, he says in 2014 his personal data was compromised in a government data breach. “There has been no compensation,” he says.

Despite findings by the UN and the Australian Human Rights Commission that Australia breached his human rights, and an Australian court awarding compensation for the assault he suffered, Khan Ali has been unable to bring a direct human rights claim before an Australian court.

While Australia has ratified international human rights treaties, those commitments remain unprotected at the federal level. Kate Ogg, professor of human rights law at the Australian National University, describes this as a significant democratic failure.

While Queensland, Victoria and the ACT have human rights laws, these frameworks do not extend to many situations refugees face – particularly immigration detention.

This legislative gap prevents Australian courts from playing a meaningful role in protecting rights, Ogg notes. “Courts are an essential aspect of the rule of law. By hearing evidence and determining legal disputes, they provide transparency and accountability – especially with respect to government action. But because most human rights issues cannot be litigated before Australian courts, much of government decision-making escapes judicial scrutiny.”

This shortcoming also limits Australia’s ability to contribute to the international development of human rights law. “When courts determine human rights disputes, they have the opportunity to consider and refer to decisions from other parts of the world,” Ogg explains. “Australian courts are largely excluded from this global judicial conversation.”

She calls this a missed opportunity. “In comparable areas of law – such as interpretations of the refugee definition – Australian courts have handed down leading decisions that have been influential in other countries.”

Much of Australia’s immigration detention regime operates in secrecy, with oversight bodies such as the Australian Human Rights Commission and the UN limited in their ability to monitor conditions or compel change. As a result, systemic issues often come to light only through legal action brought by refugees.

Ogg notes that while rulings by the UN Human Rights Committee or other treaty bodies provide important international scrutiny of Australia’s refugee policies, the Australian government does not consider these findings to be legally binding – and has, in many cases, simply disregarded them.

A national human rights act would establish enforceable protections to prevent harm, promote government transparency and accountability and mitigate impunity for rights violations.

In May 2024, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights recommended that Australia adopt human rights legislation. The former attorney-general, Mark Dreyfus, had championed an inquiry into the proposal.

Responsibility now falls to his successor, Michelle Rowland. A spokesperson for the Attorney-General’s Department says it is “carefully considering” the joint committee’s recommendations.

“Thorough consideration is required to ensure a holistic approach is taken to ensuring the rights and freedoms of all Australians are respected and protected,” the spokesperson says. “Australia has a strong history of engagement with human rights issues, and the Government is committed to ensuring Australia’s human rights framework appropriately protects fundamental human rights.”

As the re-elected Labor government weighs reform, the question remains: will Australia align its laws with its international human rights obligations",8,12,perseustree,https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/law-crime/2025/06/07/exclusive-the-lost-childhood-khan-ali-safdary,2025-06-10 07:14:00,"It is not going to solve everything for sure, but Serco has got to go. If the Australian Government deems detaining these people lawful and moral, then it should be done by a public agency not a private company.


The only benefit to using Christmas Island is it’s so hard for advocates to get to, which is why it should be shut down. Plenty of dying towns on the mainland that would gladly take the jobs. Many of them Nationals electorates. But then you’d have those pesky courts applying their pesky separation of powers.

I remember my classmates showing me extreme porn, and nude photos of classmates were shared around as a joke quite frequently.

I'm honestly shocked about it, I genuinely don't know what to do. I'm about to get married and having children is really important to us, but I want to make sure they have a good life. I've looked for instructions and experiences from others but I just can't imagine what it'll be like in their future.

I have no clue about how the trajectory of science will go, and consequently how my children will be affected by it. I often imagine that it probably involves social media a lot. When I went to HS I still had to write down my schedule in a physical book. 

I am genuinely terrified about this. I've heard too many horror stories and experienced some myself as well.

You won't be able to protect your children from everything. 

The important thing is the kind of relationship you cultivate with your child and how you handle things as they come up. 

I grew up with very strict religious and emotionally unavailable parents. My mother's strictness didn't protect me from porn, from sex, from bullying, from mental health struggles during HS etc... But it did keep me from having a safe adult in my life I could run to and get actual help from.

You don't want to be raising an iPad kid. You want to be setting and enforcing screen time limits, if you give them any screen time at all when they're super young. Encourage the kids to go to the park and socialize. Do real life hobbies. 

You're right to be shocked about internet addiction, social media, etc. But you don't need to be terrified by it. If you raise the kids correctly and teach them how to handle things like that, coming from core values and practices, they will be able to navigate the world.

I severely limit my kid's access to electronics and things like that. Zero social media. There was a time when I used electronics to raise my kid, but seeing the insanely negative effects it had, I cut down the screen time drastically. But it's easier to start low than to cut down.

One other thing is that the kid will be exposed to other kids who have unlimited or high amounts of screen time, and are exposed to bad things. There's not much you can do about that except the core values/practices things I mentioned, and relying on that as a guiding force for your kid. It won't be perfect, and you'll have to deal with your kid complaining that other kids have it better than them.",2024-09-22 17:10:35,False

AustralianPolitics,social media age restriction Australia,"Anatomy of an insult: How the PM’s Tourette sledge, apology unfolded","Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has apologised for making “unkind and hurtful” comments in parliament on Tuesday, when he mocked opposition frontbenchers by asking if they had Tourette syndrome.

Disability advocates said Albanese had set the wrong example by using the disorder as a punchline and Greens senator Jordon Steele-John said it indicated there was a long way to go before the parliament was truly inclusive.

Albanese apologises for Tourette syndrome remarks
The prime minister apologised for making the “unkind and hurtful” comments, while footage shows the reactions of Labor frontbenchers.
Albanese’s remark came in an exchange during question time, which is broadcast nationwide, when Coalition MPs interjected in the chamber as Albanese was being asked about tax changes.

“This nonsense that they carry on with ... Have you got Tourette’s or something?” Albanese asked shadow treasurer Angus Taylor and Opposition Leader Peter Dutton, using the neurological disorder as an insult. “You know, you just sit there, babble, babble, babble,” he said.

Tourette syndrome is a disorder that involves repetitive movements or unwanted sounds, or tics, that can’t be easily controlled.

Footage of the encounter shows how after the Prime Minister issued the sledge, his deputy Richard Marles grimaced and struggled to control his expression while frontbencher Anne Aly swallowed her reaction and looked around awkwardly.

It starts as an itch then the urge grows. What’s it like to have Tourette’s?
Albanese quickly withdrew the comment on Tuesday afternoon. “I withdraw. I withdraw. I withdraw and apologise,” he said. But he was lashed by Steele-John, the Greens’ disability rights spokesperson, and opposition health spokeswoman Anne Ruston, who urged him to properly apologise.

The prime minister expanded his apology in parliament on Tuesday night to a largely empty chamber. “Today, in question time, I made comments that were unkind and hurtful,” he said.

“I knew it was wrong as soon as I made the comment. I apologised and I withdrew as soon as I said it.

“But it shouldn’t have happened. And I also want to apologise to all Australians who suffer from this disability. I regret saying it. It was wrong. It was insensitive. And I apologise.”

Mandy Maysey, president of the Tourette Syndrome Association of Australia, who has three children with the disorder, said Albanese’s apology felt a bit hollow. “He didn’t refer to Tourette syndrome. He is happy to throw Tourette syndrome across the floor as an insult but when he made his apology, he said ‘people with this disability’,” she said on Seven’s Sunrise.

Maysey said people in public often used Tourette’s as a punchline or insult, and the prime minister doing so in parliament would set the wrong example. “Often you can’t go anywhere without people looking at you funny or even just being insulting ... It is really quite a distressing condition to have.

“Tourette syndrome affects one in 100 individuals in Australia, and then you have got the wider community, the families that suffer with it as well. It is socially isolating and for him to just flippantly use it in such an offhanded manner speaks volumes.”

Steele-John on Wednesday said the exchange revealed the lack of understanding of the issue in political culture, which would concern people with disabilities.

“When you look to spaces like parliament that make decisions about your life, whether you get the NDIS supports you need ... and see this type of language used, it causes a lot of fear, to think that the people in here don’t get it. Because them not getting it has huge implications,” he said.

“It says to me that there is a lot of work still to do across the parliament to actually get this ableism out of this place, and replace it with a true understanding of what disability is … and what it looks like to speak and act with genuine inclusion.”

Ruston on Tuesday described it as “absolutely despicable behaviour”.

“Mocking a disability is no laughing matter,” she said. “Australians living with Tourette’s deserve the PM’s respect, not his ridicule.”

She repeated her criticism on Wednesday morning, after the prime minister’s apology, and extended her condemnation to other Labor MPs.

“One of the most disgusting things about his comment is that if you listen to the laughter of those behind him, it wasn’t just the prime minister, there were a whole heap of his colleagues who thought it was funny to mock someone with a disability,” Ruston said on 2GB.

Liberal senator Jane Hume on Wednesday morning said the comment had been an insight into Albanese’s character, but Housing Minister Clare O’Neil defended the prime minister.

“Jane, you and I both make mistakes in our work in politics. What matters is how we deal with it afterwards, and I think it was good he didn’t pretend he hadn’t done the wrong thing,” O’Neil said on Sunrise.

“He immediately acknowledged it and made that apology.”

Tuesday’s comments were the latest in a string of exchanges that have gained publicity as Albanese becomes increasingly tetchy.

He clashed with ABC radio interviewer Patricia Karvelas over the government’s tax plans last month, accusing the media of focusing on “not terribly clever questions”, and was criticised for losing his temper during Canberra’s anti-domestic violence rally in April.

YouthRights,young people and social media ban,Sexual and gender minoritized youth in Christian home schools: Perceptions of climate and support,">**Abstract**

>In 2014, Leelah Alcorn, a homeschooled transgender teenager in the United States, died by suicide after enduring months of social isolation and her parent’s repeated efforts to change her gender identity. Sexual and gender minoritized (SGM) youth who are, like Leelah, homeschooled in the U.S. do not have access to the institutional and relational supports afforded to SGM youth in public schools. This study examines how variations in educational setting, family support, internet access, and peer relationships influence mental health outcomes in a sample of 651 sexual and gender minoritized (SGM) young adults who were primarily homeschooled in Christian homes. Participants reported extremely high rates of mental illness (87%) suicidal ideation (72%), suicide attempts (22%) self-harm (66%), and substance abuse (29%). Regression analysis revealed that a positive family attitude toward SGM people (although rare) and access to the internet were the most significant protective factors against negative mental health outcomes in this sample. This study explores the unique vulnerabilities of SGM youth in Christian homeschool settings and has implications for educators, policy makers, health care providers, and mental health and social service professionals. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the experiences of homeschooled SGM youth",7,0,DazzlingDiatom,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19361653.2019.1700404,2025-06-04 06:32:56,,2025-06-04 06:32:56,False
SocialMedia,Australia under 16 social media ban,Meta AI infiltration ,"Hey everyone, I was just about to start my social media for my nutrition business, but just heard about Meta’s (so Facebook and Instagram) plan for the foreseeable future is to fill the platforms with AI “characters” for us all to interact with. They will have their own accounts and make their own content, as well as interact with ours. Yippee. As if social media platforms aren’t already over-saturated with bots. My questions are:

1) how do you think this will affect literally everyone that relies on follower/engagement metrics for survival? Is this the end of influencers on these platforms? I can’t see a company wanting to sponsor posts if they know most of them are probably fake.

2) how will this affect paid ads? Unless they start implementing a guarantee that our paid ads will reach REAL people, then what’s the point? 

3) how do you feel about this in general? 

4) Are we going to mass exodus these platforms? I mean I’m not really that active, but it doesn’t make me want to invest any time, energy, or money knowing this. Which ones seem promising?

For anyone wondering, this is based on a quote from Meta’s VP of Product. The source seems to be a paywalled article by Financial Times but it’s being fairly widely reported on other sites that aren’t paywalled.

As for how I feel…

My FB feed recently switched from friend-based to 90% engagement farming BS that I hate. If I didn’t need the app for my business, I’d delete it from my phone. 

And my DM’s on IG are getting battered with scam bots pretending to be from Meta support. Similar situation on FB but not quite as bad.

So, before news of these AI accounts dropped, Meta was already on my shit list.

But this AI account thing is a ridiculous idea. It’s just another example of big tech finding new ways to extract more value/$$ out of all of us.

It smells of desperation.

Like, who would even want this? 

Investors.

They are obsessed with AI. All Zuck needed to do to pump Meta’s stock was just “say” they’d invest like $1 billion in AI then his stock went up by more than that figure. Can’t remember the exact amount off the top of my head.

AI is cool and all. There are plenty of useful things it can do but big tech is literally trying to replace everyone with it. Artists, creators, makers, and now actual users. 

I’m sure the next thing will be charging advertisers money to show their ads to AI bot accounts.

EDIT: Meta’s paid ads already have a bot problem as it is. Audience Network is basically a massive bot farm at this point. Not their doing but they aren’t trying to fix it from what I can tell. They are profiting from it massively though so good for them I guess (not).
---
The dead internet theory looking more likely every day now
---
Not to give Meta too much credit, but I would imagine they'd be able to filter out these AI accounts when it comes to engagement metrics, at least for ads.

There probably won't be a *mass* exodus, but we've seen Facebook in decline for years and this is likely to be another big drop in that bucket.

Now, my thought is, what does it say about the state of the internet/society that the single largest social network is becoming a ghost town in front of our eyes? Maybe this is wishful thinking, but it feels like a canary in the coal mine for the entire social media industry. If you think about it, it was only two decades ago that social media started to become a huge part of people's lives. It'd be foolish to assume it'll always be that way.

AskParents,young people and social media ban,A poor family in an elite school?,"Hello, folks!

I need opinions/advice. 

My kid is going to an elite school where I think 90% of people are really rich. You see this clearly during morning drop offs... they get chaufered in with luxury cars and some drop them off on a Ferarri or Maserati. The school fees are expesnive with debentures. 

Now, we can go to this school for free. Don't ask why. We're not rich at all. Totally below middle class. And this school almost everyone are really rich... no one we can relate to.

My question is what are the implications of this long term? I've heard and seen so many kids/young adults not being able to cope with these kinds of situations. Some get bullied for being poor. Embarassed their whole school life for being differnt and not being able to level with other kids. And this just becomes worse and worse during teeange years. We've actually already experienced some bullying from a jerk of a parent belittling us. And we can't go to any social events because they always go to expensive hotels and restaurants. 

Now, everyone could easily say 'fudge that and be proud and screw the other kids' but we all know that is not how the world works. Every child/person is different... some can handle it and some can't. What may seem little to some, are actually big problems to others. 

We have the option to move to a less prestitgious school. 

But the question is, is a top-notch education really worth going through social class discrimination for years to come (while in grade/high school)?

Is it wrong to move to a less prestigious school even though we can get the 'best' education possible for free?

Thanks, everyone.

I grew up in an area with a very ""prestigious"" school and knew several kids who went to it and they weren't smarter than anyone else I know, if anything it was more the opposite where they figured they could coast by knowing that their parents could convince someone to put in a good word to get them where they needed to go.

If you want your kid, or if your kid is old enough to express their opinion themselves and they want to pursue careers where those connections and having the name of the school on their resume/cv/college admissions matters then it's worth it to tough it out.

If you want your kid to be more likely to have a happy, healthy childhood where they aren't guaranteed to be othered, bullied, and excluded due to their ""social status"" then you probably want to pull them out of that school. 

But if the kid wants it then you need to steel them for what's coming.

We stayed at the fancy school until the financial aid didn't come through this past year. We experienced a bit of cluelessness and some families who clearly didn't quite know how to relate but no outright bullying. Which is to say, if it had been an overall negative environment I would have left. If it had actually not been a great education, we would have left. However, it wasn't. Most families are/were very accepting and while our kids certainly saw the bigger houses and wish they could have it, it hasn't ruined them with envy. By being at this school, they got to have experiences they would never have been able to have otherwise. They are around a group of families who value education and show off a lot of paths for good careers. While it's nothing we've needed or wanted yet, we do now know families with good connections in many major companies and industries. There is value to be had in just about every experience, but having grown up poor, my husband and I have been exceedingly grateful for the difference in what our kids were surrounded by at this age than what we were.

The teachers, counselors, and administrators were complicit in the bullying of poor kids where I went to school. I got a bad reputation for never allowing it (when you're poor in a rich school, you can never be labeled positively, so instead of tough, I was labeled crazy). This followed me from school to school in the district, with certain male teachers just waiting to ""straighten me out."" When my 5th grade teacher had me by the collar and wouldn't stop slapping my face (for refusing to say the Pledge Of Allegiance) I bit him on the face and didn't let go, leaving a nasty mark for a few weeks. Of course, I wasn't there to see it, I was hiding in the next town till my parent's threats of lawsuits got the charges against me dropped. Teachers always sided with the bullies. Any rich kid could slap the back of a poor kid's head multiple times and the teacher would pretend not to see it. The poor kid's first defensive move would send him to the principal's office. When some other poor kid stole an empty 15-dollar backpack? Police were called, straight to Juvenile Hall. When a rich kid stole my 100-dollar skateboard? ""Oh, please understand he has a problem and is already starting therapy for it. He comes from a good family. They would buy him 10 of those if he asked."" They literally said this to my parents. Don't worry, I got even. My advice? Listen to your kid. They may be one of those artists with social graces that slips between the cracks and fits right in. They can gain lifelong advantages from the connections built. But if they aren't, please get them the fuck out of there. I could write a book about the horrible shit done to me as a child. I'm only glad I got revenge on most of them. Including teachers and cops. See how fucked up I turned out though? That's better than the worst-case scenario.

Parenting,kids off social media,Seriously considering ending a 4 year friendship for parental boundary crossing?,"So I've been friends with this woman for several years. We were really close for about three years, but this past year the relationship is strained. I got pregnant after being assaulted by a man from tinder. The friend has made the comment that it was not rape because I had intended to sleep with him, regardless of the fact that I did tell him no. She had been trying to get pregnant for a year and she just started getting bitter, like I had done it on purpose. She has living children. I have the same number of children in heaven. So even if it had been intentional, I am also entitled to experience being a parent to a living child. I tried not to let it get to me. Emotions are weird and she truly could've been struggling with jealousy. 
Anyway I made it through my pregnancy and I had a healthy baby boy. 
I chose not to circumcise him. His pediatrician showed me how best to clean him, and when the friend heard the instructions I was given she acted disgusted and claimed she never did that with her sons and how she viewed it as ""jerking off the baby"" My reaction was horrified shock. What a repulsive thing to say about a child. Strike one. I started spending less and less time around her. At a mutual friend's birthday party when my son was 9-10 weeks old she loudly and heavily berated me for not letting him cry it out and tending to him, claiming I was spoiling him. She got one of her friends to join in and I felt ganged up on. Strike two. I let time pass with fewer interactions but Halloween comes. I go to give my son his first Halloween experience. The other parents there were all taking group pictures of their kids which I happily sat out from. Due to the circumstances of my conception I do not have social media. I do not allow others to post pictures of my child on theirs. I do not want my rapist to ever see my baby. ALL OF MY FRIENDS KNOW THIS. When the pictures were finishing up I asked if I could take one or two with my baby and the other kids. The oldest held my son and I got a couple pictures. Unbeknownst to me, the friend also took pictures of this moment. 
Less than 24 hours later my best friend sent me screenshots of my son on social media. The friend has gone through and selected only the two she had with my son in them, and posted them. She didn't ask, didn't tell me, just acted. She clearly thought because I don't have social media I wouldn't find out. I texted her asking her to simply crop my son out. She got real nasty with me saying ""oh Lord. I don't have any other pictures of my kids."" Lie. I saw her taking many. ""I'll put a penis over his face"" this is what sent me over the edge to full blown rage. Strike three. She intentionally crossed a boundary she knew about, attempted to hide it from me, minimized my reaction, lied about the other pictures, and then once again sexualized my child. 
She did take the pictures down. But only after making me out to be unreasonable for asking.

So I'm thinking this friendship is well done and over. At this point any redeeming qualities she may have no longer count. 
I'm not sure what my purpose of posting is other than maybe validation.

What a horrible person. Definitely not a friend! After that first not rape comment it would’ve been totally understandable to nope out of the “friendship” fast. Everything after that was just more and more confirmation of her shittiness. I’m sorry for what you’ve been through. Please set some boundaries around how you can be treated.

Honestly I would’ve unfriended her the moment she made the comment that it wasn’t rape. What a terrible human being.

AskParents,young people and social media ban,Am I overreacting?,"My oldest is a great kid and I’m having trouble adjusting to her being in high school, I think. She’s very young because she skipped a grade in school, but she’s always had older friends. 

Last night, she (13) went to a sweet 16 party, which then turned into going to a big Halloween event. She was with people we know and trust (including adults) but she didn’t get home until 1am when we had expected her home by 10. I was pretty upset, because I wasn’t going to bed until she was home. 

Today, I talked with some of the parents whose kids were also there last night and they told me that they went to bed and that I was being a little overprotective. We told her we’re going to have an 11pm curfew from now on, and she wasn’t mad, but I feel guilty about putting a stop on her social life. She was with safe people at a safe place, but I think she’s too young to be out that late.

No, you aren't overreacting.  There is a big difference between 13 and 16.  Imo 11 pm is a very generous curfew.
---
Honestly at 13, if she wasn't home by 10:30 when she should have been home by 10 I would have gone to the party and told her to get in the car and forget anymore parties. She's too young to be with kids that much older and she was out way too late. There's a big difference between 13 and 16, and it wouldn't surprise me if there were guests closer to 18 at that party.
---
Does she have a cell phone?

Our daughter is 21 now, so we’re past the curfew stage, but when she was a teenager we played curfews by ear. We would agree on a time for her to be home, but if she was having a lot of fun or if a movie/game/other activity was running long, she could call and give us a revised ETA and we would always say yes. Good communication and mutual respect go a long way toward maintaining a healthy relationship with your teenager.

I don't understand, why didn't you pick her up when you wanted her home? I'm sorry to be judgmental, but you should've gone to pick her up or check on her in person when she didn't get home. 

So, you're not overreacting to be upset that she blew past curfew. But, also, if it was that big of a deal, why didn't you do something about it? She's 13!",2024-10-27 21:32:30,False

teenagers,social media age restriction Australia,"Would you use a new social media app like TikTok or Instagram with posts, reels, and messaging? What features would make you switch?","Hi everyone,

I’m a developer working on a new social media app inspired by TikTok and Instagram. The idea is to keep all the creative and fun features people love—such as posting photos and videos, creating short-form reels, and direct messaging—while making the overall experience better and more enjoyable.

Here’s what I’m planning so far:

**Core Features:**

* **Posts:** Users can share photos, videos, and captions with their followers. You’ll be able to like, comment, and share posts, just like on Instagram.
* **Reels/Short Videos:** The app will have a dedicated section for short-form videos (up to 3 minutes), similar to TikTok and Instagram Reels. There will be built-in editing tools, filters, effects, and music options to make creating content easy and fun.
* **Messaging:** Users can send direct messages to friends or followers, including text, photos, videos, and voice notes. Group chats and disappearing messages are also planned.
* **Feed & Explore:** The main feed will show posts and reels from people you follow, while the Explore section will help you discover trending or interesting content from around the world.
* **Video Editing Tools:** The app will offer a suite of editing tools for both photos and videos, including filters, stickers, text overlays, transitions, and background music, so you can get creative with your content.
* **Duets and Remixes:** Like TikTok, you’ll be able to create duets or remix other users’ videos, making it easy to collaborate or respond to trends.
* **Drafts:** Save your posts or videos as drafts and edit or publish them whenever you’re ready.
* **Notifications:** Get notified when someone likes, comments, follows, or messages you, and customize which notifications you want to receive.
* **Profile Customization:** Personalize your profile with a bio, profile picture, and links. See your posts, reels, and stats in one place.
* **Privacy Controls:** Decide who can see your posts, send you messages, or comment on your content. Private accounts, block/mute options, and content reporting will be available.
* **Content Discovery:** The Explore section will make it easy to find new creators, trending challenges, or topics that interest you.
* **Hashtags and Challenges:** Participate in hashtag challenges, trending topics, or themed weeks to help your content get discovered and connect with others.
* **Analytics:** For creators, there will be basic analytics showing views, likes, engagement, and follower growth to help you track your performance.

**My questions for you:**

* Would you be interested in using a new social platform like this?
* What features do you love most about TikTok or Instagram that you’d want to see included?
* Are there any features or changes that would make you want to switch from your current app?
* What do you dislike about current social media platforms that you wish could be improved or removed?
* Are there any unique or creative ideas you think would make this app stand out?

I’d really appreciate your feedback, ideas, or suggestions. Whether you’re a content creator, casual user, or just someone interested in social media, your input would be super helpful as I build this. What would make you want to try (and keep using) a new app like this?

Thanks for reading, and I’m looking forward to your thoughts!

1. Yes
2. The ones you listed
3. Something new and original
4. Idk, i am not a hardcore user
5. Sorry i have no clue

I know i answered your questions really poorly, sorry but i am not a hardcore user… But i love the ideas tho. I would also suggest adding a original and unique feature to your app that would make it different from the existing ones. You listed a lots of features but almost every time you ended the sentence like “exactly like in tiktok/instagram”, those features are great but i would really suggest doing something new, but i have no clue what… that’s the mist i can do rn, good luck.

Education,age verification social media Australia,"Reading Intervention Research, Strategies and Programs","I have been considering writing this post for a few weeks as I have been mulling around a learning project for my time off in the summer.  I am a 24 year veteran high school history teacher in a public school in California.  I am ashamed to say that during my graduate work/credential I was never exposed to or taught the technical and theoretical aspects of the process of a child (any age) learning to read and developing progressively more nuanced and complex language comprehension.  For my fellow Cali teachers, I do have a single subject in social science with CLAD authorization, but the CLAD was nothing more than subject specific pedagogical interventions for curricular access for ELD students.  I did my credential and Clad in 2000-01.

There have been several times in my career where this issue has sprung up and given me pause to consider how best to work with a student with significant reading comprehension gaps when they are a 10th or 11th grader with no known IEP/504 issues that might complicate things.  I am now at the time in my life where I feel that I have enough emotional and cognitive bandwidth to fill this knowledge gap.  

I am looking for suggestions on reading lists, podcasts or other media that can help me build my foundational knowledge on reading and language acquisition.  I would like to understand the process of younger children learning to read and then, if possible jump to theories/strategies for older student/adult remediation and intervention.  I am also open to courses that are available to fill my gap. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you so much!",7,13,Sarahaydensmith,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/1jh6mz7/reading_intervention_research_strategies_and/,2025-03-22 11:46:32,"In the past 5 or so years, there has been a new iteration of 'the reading wars'. 

Essentially, programs that were popularized in the 80s that began to discredit phonics and other strategies proven to work by psychologists and neuroscientists are now being discredited (finally).

The breakthrough in this movement was a great podcast called ""sold a story"".  I highly recommend it.  It is great piece of investigative reporting that explores the background of these ineffective reading programs, how they were pushed by publishers, and now the efforts to replace them.

The older adolescent/young adult struggling reader demands a different approach. Nancie Atwell's ""In the Middle"" is a good start. In my perfect world, we'd have interventionists who work individually with a student to identify the obstacles and work through them. High interest/low ability books and magazine articles are essential. 

Think about a kid who exhibits low comprehension but is a baseball fan. It's really interesting to see the difference between his skill in comprehending an article about climate patterns versus, say, Stephen King's ""Head Down."" Engaging the reader is a solid first step; then talk to him about why one makes more sense than the other. No secrets, either--talk about the difference between efferent and aesthetic reading (see Louise Rosenblatt). It sounds so obvious to us, but if a kid approaches a science text expecting there to be a plot, he's going to be frustrated early on. He deserves to know why one kind of reading works for him and one doesn't. 

Another interesting exercise is to sit with the kid and have in front of both of you a short piece of writing that you have not read. Read it aloud and stop at every place you find interesting or confusing. Explain yourself: ""Now that's a word I need to break down,"" or ""That sentence is really long; I need to back up."" Struggling readers often think that good readers just sail through a piece without question. Good readers just have the benefit of working through questions more quickly or they have a richer vocabulary or a clearer understanding of context. (I worked individually with a non-reader once as we were reading ""To Build a Fire."" The first sentence contains a reference to ""the main Yukon trail."" I asked him what Yukon meant--because you must do this kind of thing--and he said, ""It's a GMC truck."" The kid knew trucks, but he didn't know about the Yukon territory. And yes, he was a teenager. Context.)

The older kids are funny. The look grown up, and they're biologically capable of just about anything they'll ever be able to do, but gaps in their skills development prevent actualization of what they might become. Phonics instruction and picture books are insulting to teenagers. But be sure to read your selections ahead of time; ""Monster"" by Walter Dean Myers is amazing for strugglers, but not appropriate for all readers.",2025-03-22 11:46:32,False

Who the hell says they have undiagnosed adhd. Either you have it diagnosed by a professional or you don't have it

This is so me. (i might also have undiagnosed adhd, though many people around me say i do and all the online tests, accurate or not say so, and the symptoms align with my experinces but i still doubt it at times.)

Honestly try a change in scenery, like sometimes i study in my room, then it gets boring then i go to the dining table. 

Also try pomodoro if you haven't already, ive tried it, doesn't really work all that well cus i end up not focusing whilst doing it. Idk for some reason i tend to space out in the middle of studying which sucks.

To add to the change in scenery part, when i have some things to study for sometimes, i use my school library after school. I'm not as comfortable there, apps like tiktok and reddit is banned from the internet at the school. 

I have tried studying with friends but i end up getting distracted or annoyed, idk though cus it might work for you.

Also maybe try attatching some words from a spelling bee to a song? Atp im just spewing out whatever pops into my head.

Have break days and have study days? like study for most of a day and then the next day do whatever? basically pomodoro but in the span of says instead of minuites. 

ALSO TRY INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC if you get distracted by lack of sound. 

I hope this is helpfull, it's a bit messy but it's past my bed time so give me some grace. I might have some more ideas in the morning when my brain isn't all mush.

Good luck with the novel. I’m genuinely curious how this will turn out.

This seems intriguing. My username is Wishing_We11. It's supposed to be ""wishing well"" but the 1s are substituting the last letters.

I'm also a new reddit user so I hope this comment goes through. I'm currently creating a portfolio where I'm designing book covers (in hopes the portfolio goes well as I used to do it back in high school before the pandemic). 

I hope your novel goes into great success!

I am intrigued by this so much! What would you think that someone like me (JP_Andersen_Official) fit?

I'd be very interested to know if I am able to fit the bill in your story.

Let me know if you'd like to proceed!",2025-02-24 00:58:20,False

AskParents,young people and social media ban,Effects of filters on kids?,"Has anyone seen AI generated pictures where you add a picture of your child and it makes them look like a princess with a castle in the background? They're super realistic and they look beautiful, adding long curly hair, makeup, making the skin flawless etc. My girls are 2 and 6, and my mother in law got pictures of them printed out. We were going to frame them for their room, but I just worry seeing themselves like that might have a negative effect on their self esteem. 

We aren't active on social media and don't post pictures of ourselves or our kids. They don't see us putting a huge value on appearances. The kids don't play on our phones, so it's rare that they'll take pictures of themselves.

When family comes to visit their aunts like to do Snapchat filters with the kids, which I'm totally fine with since it's not too often and it's special time with them. 

My biggest worry is that having these in their rooms could give them a negative self image since when they look in the mirror it doesn't look the same as the AI enhanced princess pictures of them. Am I overthinking this? I want them to have realistic expectations of what people look like, and don't want them to think they need to try to look this way. 

My mother in law already knows we are contemplating what we are going to do with the pictures and she won't be offended if we decide to get rid of them. She was conscious of these things with her girls, but filters and AI weren't around when she was raising kids so she didn't think much of it.

Go with your gut instinct.

Do not subject your children to a ridiculous standard of physical beauty.  That's on you, not your mil.  It's absolutely ridiculous to start having young girls believing that they need to be beautiful, in order to exist.
---
I have photosensitive hair and when I was a kid I was very blonde. Notably, so was my mother. 

As I aged, my hair got darker. 

My mom used to find artwork of cute Nordic girls and say it looked like me. It did get to the point that I felt like if I didn't look like that, she was going to like me less. I mean, I feel like she *did* like me less when I got less ""cute.""

When she went gray she started bleaching her hair back to the platinum blonde of her/my youth. It looks white and just ages her more.

Can you get similar pics with the cool backgrounds but still your real kids?
---
The impact will be no different than taking a picture of a kid wearing a costume, or wearing a costume in a themed setting. If you go to Disney World, there are tons of girls dressed up like princesses, taking pictures in front of the castle. 


Whether the impact of those is good or bad, I can't say. But what your describing is nothing new, it's just achieved through different means. Try to look up if hanging pictures from trips to Disney World is damaging to kids egos.",2025-01-02 05:00:53,False

AustralianPolitics,let kids be kids campaign,South Australia Minor Candidates Debate Summary,"On 19 March 6 News hosted a debate between South Australian candidates with a realistic shot at the final Senate seat. This included One Nation, Jacqui Lambie Network (JLN), Family First and a candidate formerly of Legalise Cannabis. This is a summary of what happened for those who don't want to watch an hour and a half, posted on Sunday because that's the day for personal posts such as these. It's a week late because writing these is several thousand words, several hours of watching and editing and a fair bit of research, and you are not getting more than one a week.

As previously:

[full livestream](https://youtu.be/R8fLagREPB8)

[live blog from the guy who did the live blogs](https://bsky.app/profile/anthonyzougras.bsky.social/post/3lkpr57tanc2p)

And if there are any more debates as have been teased, I will endeavour to do similar!


-	Has a special guest; my fiancée!  She is in her mid 20s and has little interest in politics but watched it with me because she knew I was interested.  I will also be including her opinions of the candidates because as a person nearly completely divorced from politics she’s probably a better example of how the average person sees this than I am.  Overall, she thought the debate lacked passion and was not too enthused by any of the candidates. 

-	Easily the most sophisticated of the debates; actual policy kept being brought up as opposed to ideological concepts.  If this is due to the general demeanour of the candidates (all four are veteran political campaigners), South Australia being a less polarised environment or if this is the old free settler stereotype manifesting, who knows.

-	Marked political shift from Queensland especially towards the centre.  Brohier attempted to argue that renewable energy drives up power prices… and got torn apart by both Patrick and Walter, with both being polite but quite clear they think he’s wrong and uneducated on the topic.  Meanwhile, Queensland had a solid 75% majority who didn’t believe climate change was real.

-	The only debate to really get into niche issues only relevant to the state.  I’m sure absolutely nobody outside of South Australia wanted to hear about the Murray-Darling Basin Plan tonight, but the candidates decided you were going to be learning all about water buybacks anyway.  Even as a resident of the state who votes primarily on the environment, I had to look up some of what the candidates meant.

-	Both Brohier and Game were absent from the debate for substantial chunks of time due to internet issues, which I will take into account (to an extent, as I think it’s also reasonable to expect candidates to have a stable connection in 2025).  I’m also somewhat convinced Game fell asleep through the start of the debate and that’s why she was late.

-	Dianah Walter used to be the Legalise Cannabis candidate but left because of what a situation that according to her, forced her to choose between the party and loyalty to the state.  Nobody asked her what this issue was which is, to me at least, frustrating.

-	This debate was generally poorly viewed, with less than 50 people in the stream and only 1/3 to ¼ the views of the other two streams.  The highlight has less than five hundred views, compared to 3,200 for Victoria and 29,000 for Queensland.  So despite being overall higher quality, it mattered even less.

-	Full disclaimer: as an SA voter, my preference order would be Patrick, Walter, Game and Brohier.

**Rex Patrick, Jacqui Lambie Network**

-	Senator for SA between 2017 and 2022, both for the Nick Xenophon Team and as an independent in all but name.  Was previously Xenophon’s chief of staff, and took his seat when he resigned to run for a seat in SA parliament.  Received 2% of the vote in 2022.  That is to say, he has the most experience of anyone here in being a politician and will be judged accordingly.  

-	Has worked in transparency since the election but prior to his political career was a submariner, then a military contractor.

-	Rex has a problem that isn’t really his fault, that being that he just *looks* like a conservative.  He has the physical appearance, clothing style, mannerisms, accent and behaviour of a 60-something from Whyalla (which he is), and it’s going to turn people off him on appearance alone because his politics aren’t what you’d expect from someone who looks like that.  The Lambie bomber jacket, while a good way of communicating the party you’re a part of, isn’t helping.  It’s hard for me to explain to a non-South Australian, but he just looks like the kind of person that votes Liberal but doesn’t follow politics at all.  Hearing a guy that looks like him say “LGBTIQ” is just… strange.

-	His background is just his office, which actually kind of works because he’s got a massive bookshelf which makes him look educated.  There’s a Father’s Day card and pictures of what are presumably his daughters, which is cute.  However, there’s also three (unopened) bottles of wine hanging out up there which might be there for decorative purposes (one of them is a Penfolds I think) but is a bit suspicious.  Webcam quality is okay but not exceptional.

-	My fiancée thought it was hilarious that he had a bunch of what appeared to be the same big red book and wondered why he had so many.  We both also agreed he looks like a family member’s ex-partner who is also from the Eyre Peninsula and around the same age.

-	World record stammerer.  His biggest weakness in the debate to me was the amount of ums and ahs that came in between what were usually quite punchy points.  It was clear that Patrick had a depth of knowledge over many of the areas, but his manner of speaking made this harder to explain.  I don’t know if it’s a lack of preparation or just how he talks but it wasn’t good.

-	Astonishingly persistent.  When an opposing candidate gave an answer he considered incomplete or incorrect, he would go after them and pin them down until they answered or the moderator intervened.  

-	Immense depth of knowledge on South Australia, the military and gas especially, all areas he focussed on in politics.  He showed a greater level of knowledge in his fields than any other politician in these debates.  When anyone challenged him on these topics, he was unassailable.

-	The three factors combined means he just talked a lot, more than any other candidate.  This let him dominate the debate to an extent, but also means more writing for me.

-	Much like Lambie herself, he’s weakest on topics where her base is split or issues where the “party” (JLN at a federal level is Lambie doing her own thing, in effect) doesn’t have a position.  Aside from a general libertarian vibe, they just don’t have concrete positions on issues like if minors should be allowed to transition.  He’s effectively a regionalist voices for SA and unlike Walter, he was unwilling to outright call these kinds of policy areas a distraction.

-	Introductory statement is for “common sense” and “not about left or right, right or wrong”.  It isn’t a very good statement, in my opinion.

-	Believes that having an independent Senator from SA is important.  This gets repeated a lot by both him and Walter.

-	Claims electricity is too expensive and is set by gas prices.  Claims that our gas is being exported overseas, which drives up prices.  Patrick wants Australian producers to be prioritised and hints at wanting a gas reservation policy simply to WA.

-	Wants to ban foreigners from “investing in housing” (am unsure if he means banning them from owning all houses, or houses they don’t live in)

-	Supports divestiture power for supermarkets if they are found to engage in a monopoly.  Part of he and Brohier’s arguments talk about this and it gets into slightly nitty gritty detail, but the simplified argument is that these powers will act as a deterrent to prevent monopoly behaviour.

-	Cuts through Brohier’s argument to state that the gas price is the primary contributor to gas prices, and that “no-one would question that”, to which Brohier responds by questioning that (or by straight up saying he thinks Patrick is wrong, rather).  He also argues that renewables have not causes the electricity price increases in South Australia.

-	Part of the stream is cut off, but Patrick believes that climate change is real, renewables are the cheapest energy option for SA and when Brohier denies climate change is a problem says “you have a choice of trusting CSIRO, or Family First”.  It’s a great line and the way he’s smirking he knows it, but it bothers me that Patrick pronounces CSIRO as one word rather than an acronym, because I’ve never seen anyone else do that.

-	Wants to see immigration “slowed” from current levels, and believes some current immigration is to “inflate GDP”.  Wants immigration matched to skills (it already is…) and specifically more immigrants to regional SA.  Wants an immigration plan that is integrated with our plans for other services.

-	Believes immigrants benefit the country, specifically citing food and seeing diverse shops.

-	Puglisi states he is “critical of AUKUS”

-	Believes that the Trump administration is not normal and are acting in ways against Australia’s values.

-	Doesn’t want increased defence spending until we show greater fiscal prudence, citing the Hunter-class and Attack-class as specific failures of spending, or we’ll be unable to spend that new money properly either.

-	Absolutely massive argument with Brohier that 6News chose as the highlight clip for the debate.  Calls him an idiot and dangerous for his suggestions, and then goes straight into the second debate when Brohier claims that Australia was unable to respond to the Chinese fleet near our coast recently.  He immediately goes in depth about our arrangements with New Zealand, the ships involved, freedom of navigation and how you might monitor a fleet in this situation.

-	Believes that the Chinese circumnavigation was not unlawful and that similar circumnavigations are done all the time in the South China Sea.

-	Generally accepting of people’s gender orientation, but in a bit “everyone should respect each other, and I won’t offer my own opinion” kind of way.

-	Abortion is a state issue, but he has no issues with SA’s legislation.  

-	Supports same-sex marriage as he thinks it harms nobody and allows Australians to be happy.

-	Is asked by Puglisi if he can commit to remaining within JLN if elected.  Patrick says he can, after a fairly weak explanation (that NXT became Centre Alliance and he only left the party after Xenophon left politics.  This is true, but he also had no chance of being re-elected as he would have been the second senate candidate behind Stirling Griff for Centre Alliance).  Says that they have different views in some ways but get along well due to their friendship and combined background.  They apparently have a “nice and flexible policy” together.  

-	Says that he only ran because Lambie kept nagging him to do it (from reading up, apparently she asked him for about a year before he finally gave in, including during the Tasmanian election period).

-	Patrick asks his one question to Jennifer Game, asking if she would cross the floor if One Nation took a position on the Murray-Darling against SA’s best interests.  She refuses to answer as it is a hypothetical question.  He says that it’s a pretty simple question and that One Nation took positions on the river that were against (in his view) SA during his time in parliament (which I had to google; what on earth is a sustainable development limit).  She just refuses to answer and eventually he gives up.

-	She then asks him about if he agrees with something Jacqui Lambie said during the COVID era, that being that everyone should be vaccinated.  He says that he’s not up to date on the science and effectively cops out of the question just like she did, so we don’t find out his opinion on vaccination.  He says “he will go with the science”.  

-	She then comes back for her hat by saying that she won’t ask him about crossing the floor as it’s also a hypothetical, to which he responds that he and Lambie do have an agreement in place for this!  He claims that if an issue affects SA and Tasmania differently they will vote differently, and if it does not affect one state (such as the Murray-Darling not running through Tasmania) one will vote for the other, which he claims is effectively a bonus vote for both sides on South Australian/Tasmanian issues.  This is actually quite an interesting idea and I wish it was brought up earlier.

-	Cites the Make Australia Make Again policy, which involves exporting more manufacturing goods instead of raw materials.  He specifically cites iron ore (which is likely a reference to the Whyalla Steelworks) and lithium batteries.

-	Will “keep the bastards honest” (yes, he said the quote).  South Australia arguably invented the Democrats and JLN is a centre party using the colour yellow so it kind of works.

-	Rex unironically calls himself the transparency warrior (it’s in all caps on his website too) in his closing statement and I know he’s a national expert on FOI, but it’s such a stupid name and makes him sound so, so silly. 

**Jennifer Game, Pauline Hanson’s One Nation**

-	An experienced political candidate, who was their candidate in 2022 and whose daughter Sarah is the only One Nation MLA in SA.  She has also (apparently) worked for Hanson since 2015.  She received 4% of the vote in that election, enough that in a double dissolution she would likely have been elected.  

-	She’s the most difficult to score in this list by far, as while she was very capable, she arrived 20 minutes late to the debate and it took her another 3 minutes to turn the light on in her room.  My fiancée and I both thought that she might have slept though the start of the debate as the light was off and she was in very casual clothes, though there’s no proof on that and it could have simply been network issues.  Once she’s online and switches the light on, the webcam is of acceptable quality though the background is just her room.

-	She’s quite eloquent and makes strong arguments.  She has the traditional South Australian accent which helps, but I’ve seen the One Nation party line three times now and Game absolutely blows the other two candidates I’ve seen away.  She just has better delivery and depth of knowledge, actually citing statistics to back up her claims, and is far better at seeing and dodging potential issues. 
 
-	I appreciate her listing policies but doing it in the closing statement at the very end of the debate is not how you do it.  It means we didn’t see a debate on any of the items listed, which might have been interesting!

-	Believes we should reduce immigration.  Claims that we would need to double our build rates to fit all the migrants coming into the state at present rates.  Wants around 130,000-150,000 migrants annually, as per the One Nation line (they want migration equal to the amount of people departing).

-	Wants migrants who assimilate well and contribute to the country.

-	Says that we don’t know if we can rely on the US as an ally.

-	Claims that Trump has a “very reasonable position” on Australia’s defence, and that he wants us to escalate our spending to avoid the US having to do the work.

-	Party position is that gender fluidity is real, but that there are only two sexes.  Says that they accept people “regardless of how they want to be.”  Immediately pivots to gender “indoctrination” in schools.  Claims that there are attempts to “interfere and sexualise our children” within schools.

-	Is asked by Puglisi if she would stay in the party if elected, considering One Nation’s history of defecting members at a state level.  She says that if you stand for a party in the Senate you should stay, and if you find that untenable you should resign rather than leaving the party.  Says she has worked with Hanson for a long time and that it won’t happen.

-	Claims that her daughter has managed to achieve several pieces of legislation despite being a single member through bringing it to state attention, and that therefore single members can be useful.

-	Does not support further water buybacks.

-	Patrick asks his question to her and while it’s on the Murray-Darling, it’s really about what she would do when what’s best for SA and what the party’s policy is diverge.  She effectively says they’d debate and decide what is best collaboratively.

-	Her question to Patrick is about if he agreed with Lambie that “everybody should be vaccinated”.  While the question is a little odd (SA had one COVID lockdown in 2021, it just isn’t the same issue here as it is in Victoria) it is an excellent question in that Patrick doesn’t really have an answer.  It is implied through her statements (and previous actions) that she does not support people being required to be vaccinated.  As mentioned above she then fumbles what was otherwise an excellent attack that really left him wrong-footed.

-	Closing statement mentions that we should focus more on young people who aren’t in employment or training.

-	Rapid-fire closing statement policies:

-	Income-splitting for families, so they can reduce their taxes

-	Removing GST from insurance

-	Halving fuel excise permanently

-	Increasing tax-free threshold for self-funded retirees to $35,000 (had to look up the details on that one)

-	Allow retirees to work more before having pensions affected.

-	Small government good, government waste bad, freedom good.

-	Believes government debt is inflationary and “another form of taxation”.

**Dianah Walter, “SA Matters”**

-	Did a little bit of research and she is a former staffer for Geoff Brock who ran for the seat of Narnugga (Fraser Ellis’ seat) in 2022, as well as a Senate candidate in 2013.  She is also the founder of Regions Matter, “a micro enterprise established to help governments, the private sector and not-for-profit organisations engage with their respective stakeholders and communities, and vice-versa.”

-	I believe she has worked in the medical field, but finding out what she has done is quite difficult. 

-	As she is an experienced campaigner, I will say that while her background is polished and so is her speech, her webcam is very suboptimal.  I also did not like her lack of specific policies, as opposed to focussing on general areas of development, especially as she has run before.  Part of this is likely due to her running originally for Legalise Cannabis, but I still do not like it.

-	My fiancée thought she had weird movements, but otherwise did not like or dislike her.

-	Very patriotic for South Australia.  Talks at length about her passion for bread and butter issues for the state.

-	Believes that climate change is real and that “renewables are the way to go”.  Cites her experience in regional SA, as well as the private sector doing the same regardless of government incentives.  Supports South Australia’s highly renewable grid (presently about 70% of power in SA is renewable).

-	Does not believe immigration is causing the CoL crisis or housing.  Claims that immigrants are being brought in to do jobs that native Australians don’t want to do, and that they’re a vital part of the economy.

-	Says that while the US alliance is somewhat important and South Australians broadly disapprove of Trump, senators should be focussing more on local issues of greater importance to voters.

-	Supports having closer relations with Indonesia specifically and the Pacific nations generally.

-	Wants a bigger focus on veterans and soldier welfare while in the ADF.

-	Wants people to be kind and respectful to one another regardless of religion.

-	Supports voluntary euthanasia.

-	Thinks that most South Australians are not concerned with if children are or are not trans/gender fluid/non-binary etc, and they have more important concerns.

-	Thinks that more attention should be given to women’s health, citing specific examples of areas that need care from her experience.

-	Supports increased money in all care, including preventative care and mental health.

-	She still supports legalising cannabis, despite no longer being a member of the party.  Also supports the use of cannabis for children, but only in a medical context.

-	Wants to develop an SA hemp industry.

-	Did not have a final question for any members of the panel, which to me is poor preparation.

-	Supports raising the rate of Centrelink payments (I believe she’s referring to Jobseeker specifically).

**Christopher Brohier, Family First**

-	It’s impossible to discuss Brohier’s performance without mentioning his sheer insistence on trying to pick fights on topics that Patrick is an expert on.  Basic research or simply paying attention to SA politics between 2017 and 2022 as I’d expect a former lobbyist to have done, would have shown the folly immediately.  He doesn’t win a single one; it’s an insane strategy to argue with someone who is known for being persistent on topics he has far more experience on, and yet Brohier keeps doing it again and again.  In terms of oratory every person who’s been in a parliament (bar Roberts) has been a more eloquent and fluid speaker, but Patrick is deeply knowledgeable and willing to go in for the kill in a way that nobody except maybe Rennick has been, and Brohier kept offering himself up on a silver platter.

-	Is a barrister and the former director of the SA branch of the Australian Christian Lobby.  He brought up that he’d been a barrister for 40 years several times.

-	Managed to achieve the feat of having my fiancée actively dislike him by the end, a unique distinction.  While she generally considered the candidates not great, he was definitely the one she liked the least. 

-	His signal wasn’t great which means at times he cut out.

-	Brohier kept getting way, way too close to the camera, to the point that sometimes not even all of his head was visible.  His webcam quality wasn’t bad (with a Family First background, albeit covered up by the news ticker) and he spoke eloquently, but towards the end he kept all but eating the camera.

-	Three key policies in the opening statement.  They are:

-	Reducing CoL by “attacking power prices”. 

-	Opposing minors transitioning.  They also do not want “the promotion of gender fluid ideology in schools to young kids”.

-	Opposing faith-based schools being considered under discrimination laws.

-	Claims that the “real cost of energy has gone up 65%” between 2007 and 2021, and that renewables have caused this.  Wants “dense” power, including potentially nuclear.   Argues that it “can’t” be true that renewables are cheaper due to the high transmission costs and firming.  He specifically argues for gas and coal-fired power stations.

-	Says “the climate catastrophism just isn’t happening”.  At this point Patrick goes to reply and Puglisi jumps in, as Walter has been waiting patiently while the two go at it for several minutes.  She then not-so-subtly implies he doesn’t know anything about regional SA or power.  After a little more back and forth they move away from the topic.

-	Claims that Woolworths and Coles do not have a monopoly.  He provokes a fight with Patrick over the JLN’s policy to have a law to break them up which as a lawyer he should win.  However, Patrick does a good job in explaining how it has a deterrence value and then can cite him personally attempting to introduce a bill for this, as well as citing support.

-	Wants immigration closer to pre-COVID levels of around 200,000 per annum.  Believes this will help housing.

-	Ambivalent about the US’ strength as an ally and wants to build up an independent capability.

-	Claims that DEI is why the ADF doesn’t meet its recruiting targets, and that they are not recruiting on merit.  This is not an exaggeration.  He argues that the US Army has gotten more recruits since abandoning “DEI” and that even if they do recruit on merit, the optics are that they do not.  He then ends up in an argument with Patrick again, who is the only person on the panel with a military background, on military recruitment.

-	Claims that China sailing a convoy near our waters and (he claims) our inability to track them was a sign of our weakness.  Patrick immediately disputes his claims using his decades of experience in the Navy and military contracting, and it devolves into another debate until Puglisi moves the topic on.

-	Is asked about how he and the party represent non-Christians.  He says that he will represent people based on the dignity of the individual, and that God does not accept forcing your beliefs on others.

-	Disapproves of South Australia’s abortion laws (abortion up to 28 weeks in cases where it affects the mother’s mental or physical health), and claims they had a poll that said so in 2021.  Claims this policy is “brutal” and that babies are born alive.

-	Wants support for mothers so that “abortion isn’t the only option” (a paraphrase)

-	Puglisi (the moderator) cites Family First’s manifesto, which argues for the reversing of gay marriage as a policy.   Brohier says that he didn’t know Lyle Shelton said that and that instead they want to support straight marriage instead.  He believes we have to ""live with the consequences"" and that it won't happen by 2025.

-	Claims that straight marriage is the best kind of marriage and that gay marriage led to gender fluidity (being accepted I assume he means here).

-	Is the only person in any debate so far (12 candidates) who does not support legalising cannabis in any form.  Claims that it can be harmful for children and that there is no research on dependency.",6,5,Thomas_633_Mk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/1jnbed6/south_australia_minor_candidates_debate_summary/,2025-03-30 12:31:15,"Thanks, this is actually the most interesting of the debates. It's a shame that views were so low since it seems like Patrick did well and he may have gained a few votes otherwise. I've been leaning towards One Nation taking a Senate seat off the Libs in SA (along with too many other states) since Lib polling is disastrous and One Nation is doing fairly well and this is cementing that, also disappointing that it seems like this may not be a ON member that randomly defects. Family First is making me hate them more every time I read something about them, and I love how the lawyer wasn't able to debate properly. I'm still not clear on the point of defecting from LC to SA Matters but Walters seems like the candidate that would most align with my politics probably.

AskAnAustralian,age verification social media Australia,Ned Kelly - is he really all that famous?,"Hey, I need to write an essay for school and my teacher complained that all the information I had was basically copied from the internet. I’m not really sure where else I should get information from - as I’m not from Australia and don’t know anyone who is from there, so maybe I could ask people here some questions about Ned and I’d really appreciate it if someone answered these. 

1. How did you first hear about Ned Kelly? 
2. Do you think he’s a hero or not? -why? 
3. Have you heard different stories or opinions about Ned from your family or your social surrounding? 
4. Is the story of Ned Kelly perceived differently in different regions of Australia/ people of different ages/ people of different ethnicities? 
5. Are kids being taught about Ned Kelly in school? 
6. Does Ned’s story still affect politics in any way? 
7. How important is he to people living in Australia today?

He was a rebel, and people love that, but he was also a violent criminal, and people don't love that so much.  


Much like Billy The Kid, his story as over time become romanticised, and it's seen more as folklore than raw historical fact now.  


1. I first heard about him in primary school, as part of lessons on Australian history.
2. Not really, but I can understand why he did what he did. He was a man pushed too far, sorta like an old timey Marvin Heemeyer. 
3. Some people see him as a heroic figure, some see him as a criminal that Australia should really be trying to dissociate from.
4. It seems to be more of a class divide. Bogans mostly seem to idolise him. Most others don't really think about him at all.
5. Hope it still is. Love him or hate him, his story is now Australian folklore, and if anything it offers a well documented insight into the lives of the poorest early settlers.
6. Not in the slightest.
7. Again, not very important at all. Just an interesting story from our past.

Great to see you are getting some really thoughtful answers on here. I don’t have anything to add about any of your specific questions that someone else hasn’t already said, but I’d like to comment a little more on Ned Kelly’s armour which a few people have touched on. 

I am in my early 50’s and I do recall learning about Ned Kelly in  primary school in the late ‘70’s. Some of the emphasis of that learning was on Kelly’s use of armour. 

Kelly’s construction and use of armour reflected his ingenuity and determination to stand up to, and defeat the police who pursued him which added to his infamy. 

The specific design of the armour, particularly the helmet, was simple and homespun, but it was also unique and recognisable. It has become iconic and part of colonial Australian folklore as a result. 

There is a belief today that the armour kind of hid Kelly’s identity and added to the intrigue around him at the time. I don’t know whether that’s true or not but it would be interesting to research through the news archives. The armour was also effective, evidenced by a number of dents made by police bullets when it was recovered following Kelly’s capture. 

The armour set Kelly apart from other bushrangers of the era and the simple design has been captured in art over the generations since, probably most notably by artist [Sidney Nolan](https://nga.gov.au/exhibitions/ned-kelly/) in the 1940’s, ensuring he is remembered. 

There were dozens of paintings in Nolans Ned Kelly series and an acquaintance of Nolan’s donated 25 of them to the Australian National Gallery in 1977. There may be no coincidence that Kelly was in the primary school curriculum around that time. 

The only other thing of interest I can contribute is that Kelly’s last words before he was hanged at the Old Melbourne Gaol in 1880 are believed by many to be “such is life”. 

While the exact words are not clear, at the time Kelly was reported to have said “I suppose it has come to this” or something very similar. This may have been distilled to “such is life” in the retelling since. 

Nevertheless, the saying ‘such is life’ has become part of the Australian vernacular (and a popular tattoo!) forever linked with Ned Kelly.

Are you sure your teacher didn’t mean you didn’t write it in your own words? 

1 - in school, doing a project
2 - no, I’ve heard of better stories of actual heroics.
3 - No
4 - can’t answer. I grew up rural NSW, now live in Brisbane and can’t say I’ve ever discussed Ned Kelly. 
5 - my daughter is in her last year of primary school this year and hasn’t learnt about him, so I’m doubtful
6 - no
7 - not at all important

But in reality the best they can do is hand out how to vote cards. Does anyone actually take these and follow them?

Is there any evidence/research on the effectiveness of how to vote cards (& therefore party preferences) in Australia?

From how preference flows swing around so much (Prahran, South Brisbane) they do have an impact. Not sure of exact figures
---
If you want evidence look as what happens when a major party has it's preferences distributed in the count. You are then able to see how many follow the how-to-vote card.

I think that many do, possibly still the majority. But more and more people are doing their own preferences. 

In Higgins about 10 to 12 percent of 1 Green votes preference the Liberals ahead of the ALP.

And about 10 to 12 percent of 1 ALP votes preference the Liberals ahead of the Greens. 

I doubt that many people change their major party vote due to the posters and handouts outside the booth. 

But there is a big difference in the Green vote, especially their senate vote, if there are Greens handing out cards. This is because the Green's presence reminds voters that there is an alternative to the major parties. So the people handing out Green's HtV cards do make a difference.
---
As far as I know it is about 30% follow the HTV cards. I don't actually have a source on this though, just memory from when this was discussed previously.

But beyond that there are a lot of voters who either don't care or aren't politically engaged beyond a very high level of Labor or Liberal. These are the voters where the HTV card has impact, as they'll blindly follow it.
---
Note that the primary purpose of HTVs isn't actually to direct preferences.  It's to help ensure that the voters a party does get fill out a formal ballot.  In the federal system where a ballot gets thrown out if you don't number every box, it helps a lot to have an example to follow, especially for new voters and especially especially for new citizens coming from other systems in other languages.

The ALP in Victoria is preferencing Legalise Cannabis ahead of the Greens.

The candidate for Legalise Cannabis in Victoria is Fiona Patten. She has a long history in Victoria. 

First she was head of the Sex Party (which got funding from the sex industry). She then formed the Reason Party. The bloke who came up with and then organized the preference whispering was on her staff. Preference whispering was used to elect her to state parliament. At the next state election they must have fallen out, so she spoke against preferencing whispering (never mentioning that she had won because of it). 

Given her history of deals, I would not be surprised if a deal has been done with the ALP with her preferencing the ALP ahead of the Greens and the ALP returning the favour.

We don't know the Legalise Cannabis how to vote card yet. So they may preference the Greens above the ALP. I hope that this is the case.

From a technical point of view, simply marking data as ""deleted"" is often much easier than actually deleting it. When deleting some entity, you will also have to cascade delete or update every single entity related to it, otherwise they will point to a non-existent entity. For example, when deleting an Instagram account, the developers would also have to delete or update every single post, every single file from each post, every single reaction to each post, every single comment to each post, every single reaction to each comment to each post, every single subscription to the account, every single comment and reaction that the user made to other posts, etc. It's just easier to simply hide the account behind deleted flag.
---
That data activity makes these companies money, why would they remove it?
---
There's several reasons but here's an important one ...

You might put yourself in the seat of someone trying to make million dollar decisions with your data.  Who to promote to, how to promote to them, what they care about and what they dislike.  Would you want to start with more or less data?

Most people looking for decision support want as much data as they can get.

For these companies that make money from user data, people will pay for outdated information because it's historical.  The value of new and recently produced data is far, far more valuable (which is why we tell people to delete their Facebook accounts TODAY) but it can all be sold or applied to advertising.

For privacy concerns, this is a huge problem because it means mistakes you made 10 years ago could follow you, especially in the case of a major data breach.  Social media is littered with stories of people turning their lives around, how would it work if you could never turn the page on bad credit or a failed marriage or a car accident that was your fault?  It's dangerous.

‘Deleted’ data is also a valuable resource. At the very least, you can build and maintain a generalised profile of users who are prone to deleting their data and take some action to encourage them to stay with you.",2025-01-04 08:42:36,True
teenagers,kids off social media,I got hope for sum of yall,"As I approach my 18th birthday this week and welcome adulthood, I think it's a good time to drop sum knowledge on u guys cuz ik damn well u guys need it. For reference, I quit reddit years ago and it was the best decision of my life. I was awkward asf jus like alot of u guys but I been working on myself since and now I'm living my best life. 

1. Getting girls. Lots of yall got no idea how to talk to women or whoever u interested in romantically. Alot of u guys have crushes, which is cool if ur in middle school but you get into 'too grown' territory around highschool. If you interested in someone you need to talk to them. The act of talking to someone is never inherently weird, even if you don't have a reason- it's only weird if you make it so. What u need to realize is that social skills/charisma is a skill, and like any skill needs to be practiced in order to get better at. If you want to get better, get in the habit of talking to girls even if you not interested. It will make u sound much more confident when you talking to someone you do like. I know the idea of this might revolt some of u, but a great low-risk way of developing ur flirting skills is getting snapchat and talking to random ppl. I have social anxiety just like many of you, and the exposure therapy works- U just need to leave ur comfort zone fr. Do it in small steps like any skill. Much of the nervousness you get comes from being afraid to come off as weird or creepy. This nervousness radiates to whoever you're talking to and turns them off a bit. Id say talking to girls is about 40% what you actually say and 60% delivery and confidence. You are prolly familiar with the popular kid who says the dumbest shi but still gets girls cuz of how confident he is. Keep in mind getting this confidence is also a long process. ALSO, girls r people. You can't view them as a prize or idolize them. That's creepy. Girls got no problem with guys that r nice, they got a problem with ""nice guys"" who only act nice to get something from them. Avoid saying ""females"" whenever you can. 
2. Reddit has this weird thing where ppl associate 'basic' things with being bad. U guys did this with emojis, Fortnite, tik tok, music ect. Express individuality, yes, but you don't have to hate things just because they're popular or because reddit told you to. Im not sure if this is still a problem but it was when I left this app. Nothing wrong with having some 'normie' tendencies- you don't have to derive your sense of self from being different than the mainstream. U guys are missing out on alot of stuff because of this narrow worldview. 
3. Reddit without moderation is cancer and you should touch grass. I know alot of you are stuck in the reddit cycle because of poor mental health. I feel for u because some of you guys be going thru some real shi that I'm lucky to have not been through. I'm not claiming to have the cure to depression, but I feel with a good level of confidence that living life will leave you better off than youd be if you continued to scroll reddit the whole day. There is so much experiences to be made in the world. You could pick up a hobby or interest and be part of an actual community. To fill my time after deleting reddit, I learned guitar, started working out, and joined the football team (I was trash lol u dont even have to be good.) I'm so grateful for spending my time like I did because now I have all these cool skills and met all these like-minded people. I'm not saying ditch reddit or social media entirely (in fact it could be helpful sometimes,) but just bear in mind that none of it is actually real.
4. Stop beating ur meat. At least recognize that it is an addiction just like alcohol or drugs and that it has bad affects on your mind. It might not have tangible affects like drugs do, but it greatly alters your mind and the way you think about women. Quitting will be really really hard and I even relapse sometimes and that's because its an addiction. It's so bad that reddit came to the point where it's so normalized. There are millions of videos out there about how to stop beating so much- watch some of them im too tired to reiterate their points rn.

AskParents,kids off social media,How would you deal with your child's disability diagnose?,"I just found out my sibling has down syndrome. She is 4 years old and it was revealed in a blood test. It's been 3 days and I am still upset about it.

This has been a whole thing. When she was first born, my mom phoned home and said ""She has a syndrome. I want to die"" (translated) and I spent days sulking while she went to appointments to determine whether it is true or not.

Some doctors said yes, some said there's nothing wrong, most agreed if she has it then it is only light or mild. One doctor told us that her condition is light and whether or not she gets to live a normal life depends on whether we treat her as normal or not. So we did, and there was a sense of normality restored. She turned out to be really cute, loving, etc.

But she was always seemingly behind her peers. She couldn't sit down until I taught her to do it at around the age of 1.5, then walking was a challenge, but we got her to do it at maybe slightly older than 2.

We never had a blood test done at the time because I'm not sure but the Iraqi doctors never did it. Perhaps resources or something. When she came to Australia on her second trip, they did the blood test, and that's how the news was confirmed.

Now her challenge is talking. She is having basically daily appointments with speech therapists to start speaking and is starting to make only some progress. For example, the word ""hair"", she would repeat as just say ""airrr"" as in barely reminiscent of the original word - let alone complex sounds. She is surrounded by loving cousins aged 4-9 that also do their best to help there (this is back in Iraq, FYY. Dual citizen).

And she also does not seem to be growing a bit slowly in terms of height, almost like she is still in the baby phase of stature. I just want her to live a normal life.

We took her to a speech therapist in Australia and after a session she said she wasn't sure why she wouldn't speak but with more practice she should start speaking eventually. She did not even realize/mention potential down syndrome, and people often told us in the streets that ""she is the most beautiful girl I have ever seen, don't forget that"" before she went back to Iraq, so it is clear many do not recognize at least at first sight she has it.

Maybe I am blowing things out of proportion. I just get upset when I see young people doing ""normal"" things on social media that she might never be able to do. I have a trip to Iraq in a few weeks (returning for my first time in several years) and I was excited but now I'm not.

When we got the results, I expected mosaic Down Syndrome or some mild genetic or developmental condition not as severe but it was down syndrome, and its unexpected since she just does not seem like she would have down syndrome in regards to the way she plays, interacts, etc.

Quite disheartening to think that the sister from a few days ago who seemed mostly normal, maybe some mild-ish genetic condition or a speech delay, loved by all around her now is diagnosed a condition where one of the most popular search terms is ""life expectancy"". I half-expected this even though her symptoms didn't seem like anything of substance, but it's still a blow.

What will her life look like? marriage/family prospects? jobs??!?! Can we avert a severe case with intense early intervention like we are now with the near daily speech therapists and considering that her case isn't that severe in the first place? When do people with down syndrome learn to talk? 

Because at the moment, she is normal, fine. basically like other kids. But in the future?

I...don't know.

Thoughts?",6,5,SessionGloomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskParents/comments/19b9r0u/how_would_you_deal_with_your_childs_disability/,2024-01-20 11:26:09,"It's a spectrum. Don't be scared. You will manage. Plans change. See where it takes you. Life is not about achieving goals, about having picture perfect this or that to impress the neighbours. 
The value of a person doesn't get defined by their achievements, neither yours, nor the kid's. 

Things will be fine, and different.

You can't change the cards you have been dealt, but you can change what you do with them. Maybe not play cards at all, but build a beautiful mobile, cut out a star, whatever from the card board.

Be open and understand that your expectations are yours, and they can change. Life is not about achieving things.

The diagnose doesn't change anything about who your sister is. 

She is going to do things on her own timeline, and when she's in her 20s it isn't going to matter if she learned to talk at 2 or 5. It's great that she's starting to talk and can say 'air' for 'hair' - that's fabulous progress! It's also typical for kids to mispronounce words or drop a letter, whether they have DS or not.

The most important thing here is not to compare her to other kids. You probably didn't like it when you were compared to a sibling or cousin, because you're your own person. So is your sister. Just look at each moment she succeeds at and be happy at her progress. 

I will say, having a child with disabilities can be a true gift. Be extra proud of your sister every time she accomplishes something, because she has to work that much harder at it.

Lastly, I'll leave you with an image. It's called The Fairy of Pure Joy, by Brian Froud.

It might help to remember that a diagnosis is just some new information you have now, nothing has changed about your sister. She is exactly who she was before you knew.  You just understand her challenges a bit more now. It sounds like she is growing up surrounded by love and support, and that gives her the best chance. People grow on their own timelines. 

If she's struggling with speech, you might want to look into getting her an AAC device. Even kids who are very verbal can sometimes benefit from them, it's just another way to communicate. My son is autistic, and although he was an early talker and had a huge vocabulary at 4, he sometimes used a speech program on his tablet. Sometimes he just couldn't access the words, but the thoughts were still there. I'm sure your sister has thoughts she wishes she could express too

People with Down's syndrome have a much better quality of life than they did years ago.  It all depends on the severity and how they're raised.

If your sister is 4 and only just diagnosed, she must be have very mild down's.

In my country, the uk, many adults with Down's have jobs, get married, can drive, all of the things that a person born without Down's can do.

There's even a young actor who has a regular part in a drama called ""Call The Midwife"", the lad who plays Reggie has been in the series for about 6 yrs now. He's also not the only actor with Down's on the tv.

Just keep on treating your sister like you always have, and the sky's the limit for her.

My son is almost 4 and doesn’t speak.  He uses an app called “Proloquo” to communicate.

I'm not sure about any actual evidence, but feels like one of those things that may lead to harm with no benefit. If you want to post a first day of school photo, you can do so with just the grade or other more generic information vs including the school and teacher name.

Granted I'm not an expert of old newspapers, but I'd be surprised if they included the actual street address. Plus you'd have to actually buy the local newspaper every day to maybe get that info. Much harder for cousin Bob a state over to get vs seeing a social media post.

It’s just a lot to be sharing online. I don’t think that anyone could easily find out where your kids go to school since they could go to a charter school, private/religious school, or homeschool. The only way someone would know is if you choose to put it out there online. I don’t share my children on social media at all, but if I did, I would probably at most do a plain “first day of school” pic to share and then a pic with the whiteboard to keep for myself and print for a scrapbook. No one else needs that information…the point of the whiteboards as I understand it is so that you can look back years from now. Anyone who knows your child will know all the info on the board anyway. If someone doesn’t even know you well enough to know your child is going into fourth grade, they don’t need to learn that (and all the other info) on Facebook. Just an unnecessary risk to take and one that’s easy to avoid.",2024-09-01 02:59:01,False

The answer is all 3.


Parents have ultimate responsibility for ensuring their children are safe. But you can't helicopter your kids 24/7, especially after a certain age.


Tech companies are proven not to have users' best interests at heart, doubly so if it gets in the way of revenue. So it falls to government to ensure those tech companies are implementing the right safeguards.


Enforcement is a problem. Especially since many lawmakers simply don't know how tech works, and often push for unworkable solutions. Still, they should work together to find the best way to protect kids. Flat bans are not necessarily effective.


Education is also important here. Staying safe online, spotting fraudulent images, keeping media use within healthy limits. These things need to be taught in schools too.
---
Tech companies should be held accountable for basic content moderation, and perhaps allow parental controls (but tech-savvy people can always find a way to bypass this, like pretty much every use-restriction). Anything more than that is asking for too much imo, because it gets in the way of user's individual rights. 

The biggest example of this is ""age-verification"". There's a lot of issues with requiring age-verifications, but the one that affects the most people is that it violates their personal privacy. Take a look at Facebook's user verification for example, where they ask you to upload a video of yourself, along with (maybe) an ID. What's stopping them from abusing that information? We all know the government isn't going to do it.",2025-03-28 16:38:49,False

Make them work for that 30 minute of short.
If they need to read 1 hours to have 30 minute of screen time they will think about more.

It's also about asking them why they want screen time.
You want to be brain dead after a long day playing outside that's good.
You want to look at the popular video kids are talking at school, that's good.
You want to look at crafting ideas online, that's good.
You want another 30 minute of short for no reason, that a no no.

Talking about the danger of something is often touched on either by a conversation or by sparking a conversation reading a book or listening to a movie.
Listen a hoarder serie with them or a disfunctional family getting help on TV and pause and talk about these dangers.

Fast forward to tonight she posted another and my partner told her (not so nicely this time as we’ve told her before) to delete the photo and she blocked the both of us and we found out of a mutual friend the photo of our daughter was still up there so my partner went and told her AGAIN this time not nicely at all, his mum then STUCK UP for his sister and then proceeded to say she never posted it on the said media platform but we BOTH saw it with our own eyes (so she lied to their mum). I then sent his sister a message explaining that I don’t care what the reason is she isn’t to post photos of my daughter as her let alone us don’t even know people on her social media and they could be a ped* for all we know, she then “emoji reacted” (a feature on Facebook messenger) to the message with a 😱emoji. She also got her mum involved and got her to fight her battles for her and my partners mum has told us she has taken it down but as it’s pretty late where I am right now my friend who has been watching her page to see if it’s gone has most likely gone to sleep. 
But how would you react/deal with or say to anyone in this situation? (I’m also not great with confrontation usually it’s makes me VERY anxious)

Get all of your friends to report the photo to FB. They will take it down.
And she would be banned from swing the baby.

I would calmly explain that your daughter is an individual and should have full control of her own social media presence once she is old enough.  That is the choice you and your partner have made for her.  If the sister and mother in law can't be trusted then they will have to have limited supervised visits with her.

AskParents,young people and social media ban,"My 9yo may have accidentally outed a friend, any tips/experiences to share to help navigate this?","My 9 year old woke up last night quite upset about an interaction she’d had the previous day with some older  students at school (it’s vacation care at the moment rather that the regular school term) where they tricked her into to disclosing that her friend in her year had a crush on someone. She was really worried about how her friend might react when it gets back to them and if they’d stop talking, etc.  We had a bit of a chat about waiting to see what happens and being prepared to apologise to her friend because she broke their confidence. And we also talked about tactics to use if someone is trying to get her to disclose more than she wants or should (ie deflecting, making jokes or giving a silly/absurd answer). 

We had another chat this morning and it became clear that her friend had said their crush was a same sex one and that she definitely hadn’t told anyone else. I feel that this gives a bit of a different lens to the situation and that she may have unintentionally outed the friend - they’re still quite young and whilst we’ve talked about rainbow families in our social circle, and she understands that there are some people we know with same sex partners, we’ve never made a big deal of it so haven’t covered things like coming out and why it’s important to let people do that themselves.  I think she may not have recognised that sometimes things can be a bit different for people who aren’t in straight relationships because to us we don’t talk about treat people differently based on who they love.

We had a bit of a chat about how sometimes people with same sex attraction face discrimination, so it really should be up to them to come out. And to be extra careful if someone takes her into their confidence. We’ve also looked at some info on fracture and repair in friendships and how it is hard to admit you’ve done the wrong thing, but it’s important to do it to mend things in healthy relationships.

I think there’s a really strong chance that the older kids may not even think twice about the gossip and by the end of the weekend it will be a non-issue, but there’s also a chance this will get back to her friend. Based on the area we’re in, the profile and culture of the school, I’d be very surprised if they was any physical threat, but obviously there may be the risk of bullying if the kids in question are real jerks.

Does anyone have any advice or insight to help navigate this?",5,4,Gumnutbaby,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskParents/comments/1dr4c1x/my_9yo_may_have_accidentally_outed_a_friend_any/,2024-06-29 05:53:30,"It's a life lesson that your child will have to learn unfortunately.

AskParents,young people and social media ban,How do I stop a parent from bullying me? ,"I know this will generate a broad array of answers. I’m just interested in knowing if I’m the only one that got a shit end of the stick here

I’ll make this quick and easy. ( okay came back to say it’s not at alll quick or easy, sorry) 

Both my parents are alcoholics/ former drug abusers. Neither one raised me, in fact I found out my GMA adopted me when I was ooooohhh 11-12 my aunt told me. 
Anywhoo ever since I tried to have a relationship with my birth mom and lived with her for summer at 14 and fall semester at 16.
Got into some trouble as a kid ie I failed classes in highschool and was sent to a secondary school. Smoked pot, brought an empty container that smelled like weed in my backpack one day. 
Got everything taken from me by said mom I barely knew while I lived with her for one semester of highschool and ran away for one night to be with a boy. Never did anything bad again. Then the worst night of my life happened. 


One night she gets drunk has a mental breakdown and attacks every single family member including me. Gets taken to hospital is put on 50/50 and sends me home to GMA on a plane. Didn’t say goodbye, had her husband do it. didnt talk to me for two years even when I told her I was homeless she said I did it to myself ( ya I left cuz GMA wasn’t buying shampoo toothpaste tampons or clothes so I dropped out and worked full time, she said couldn’t live there cuz it would affect her wellfare $)
Decided once I had a baby she was going to talk to me again
She moved me in with her after my ex threatened to kill me and smothered me in a pillow. 
Wouldn’t let me date, said she’d watch the baby for 4 hours a day while I worked but left her in pack n play so she could drink and smoke. Would call me to come home. Kicked me out early because I wouldn’t stop seeing my new bf (who she threatened multiple times) 
Cut off contact with her  after she made me move out the day after a drunk driver t boned me and my car flipped 3 times. 

She tried messaging me again when my second daughter was born and decided within 24 hours that she changed her mind I guess? 

Ever since then she’s texted me from fake numbers, pretending to be random people she’s friends with. I’ve even asked them if it’s them. She texts me just like she texts usually and then says the same things on her actual phone number so I know it’s her lol. 

Now she’s best friends with my exes wife who’s main goal is to literally be me, try to take my kids with false allegations and is pretty much exactly like me besides the fact that she’s ugly inside and out. 

My mom offered my ex husband to move in with her to a different state after he beat me in the street and was discharged from the military for it. 
She continues to blame me for everything bad that’s ever happened to me. 
She logs into my emails and social medias and sends my messages to my ex. 
She told my step dad to cut off contact with me. I thought they were divorcing. Apperently my mom had cameras set up for when he invited me over for a glass of wine to talk about the divorce. Naturally I told him I’d always love him like a dad and he deserves to have the life he wants. ( he wanted kids she didn’t but she promised to look into adoption, she’s unfit, naturally. )

My daughter is around her without my knowledge due to my ex and his new wife. She was removed from a base for being accused is some weird shit with a kid, she’s abusive and alcoholic and I don’t want my daughter around that crazy behavior. 

In the end I feel destroyed. All I ever wanted was my mom. And I feel like I never got her. And she hates me with everything she is. It often makes me hate myself.

AskParents,young people and social media ban,"Cousin hooked to social media, impacting her negatively","**Context**

So my (23m) little cuz (6f) here has a lifestyle where she's totally hooked onto social media and short form content. She has her own internet enabled phone but she insists on using her moms, I'm assuming it's cuz she's made hers a mess from all the game apps lol.

This lifestyle has come to effect and enforced owing to their parents being in a tough financial spot, one of them having a toxic af job and both of them not having enough attention to spare and basically leaving the internet to occupy her while they're busy. (except for when she's at school, tuiton, or her 1hr playing time at the park)

but the thing is the content she gets regularly fed is the kind that knows it's gonna be fed to small children and tries to farm them for stats like subs, game downloads, engagement etc.

not only that, she has parroted some weirdly misogynist degenerate stuff that i can only assume comes from the shorts she watches.

**The Plan**

So her birthday is right around the corner in April, and I plan to gift her a smartphone.

This phone would be internet disabled, but would have external storage containing a huge repository of child friendly content. Books, videos (even shorts), movies, songs, anything and everything that won't have a negative impact on her.

what I haven't figured out is making the entire thing as addictive as social media. Cause if she doesn't get that dopamine hit she might want to occupy her mom's phone rendering the whole point moot.

**Conclusion**

Anyone who's tried this sort of thing before, how did it go? What else can I do ensure maximum effectiveness of this?

Additionally, what other measures do you suggest to remedy this problem? ty : )",5,4,Heausty,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskParents/comments/1aneao3/cousin_hooked_to_social_media_impacting_her/,2024-02-10 11:28:29,"I think this is a great initiative, but if she’s already using her mom’s phone, do you think she’d adopt this new phone?

AskParents,young people and social media ban,What age did you give your child a phone? ,"My 39f mom bought my 9&10 sisters an iphone 15 today. She said there will be strict rules with them. They will be charged downstairs at night and no social media. They can watch Disney+ & Netflix but no Youtube. They’re going to take them to school with them. 

Almost every kid in their grade has a cellphone. I can see how it’ll be good for them to communicate with their friends but I think all messages should be read. 

They already messaged random people on roblox and talked to them in a game on there. My mother and I have both said they’re not allowed to chat with strangers online but they still talk to them. They don’t understand the danger of speaking with random strangers online, especially who don’t even have any profile pictures. 

I’m worried they’ll accidentally discover porn or inappropriate content. I was their age when I discovered it and became addicted until I was caught. Another concern of mine is that they’ll download social media and youtube and just delete it frequently. 

Is there a way to prevent this? What age did you give your kids a cellphone? I had my first phone at 6, it was a flip phone. I got my first android at 12 but I didn’t keep track of it. Then around 14-16 I would talk to people on Omegle and Kik. I don’t think they should have these phones due to the unlimited access they have to what’s on the internet. 

Update: My mom gave them their phones and there’s parental guidance so it blocks anything older than 12+ which means they can’t download Netflix or Roblox and anything they can download must get verification from the parent. I still dislike it but as long as the PG controls are on, I guess it’s okay. I just know that once I’m a parent, my kids aren’t having a phone until they’re 18.

I don't know about Roblox, but my kids learned online safety on Animal Crossing. My kid said the game gave them online rewards if they took safety lessons, so it incentivized safety lessons that told them not to give out personal info; and they also had settings to limit the amount and types of interactions, so maybe they could only interact using set phrases, etc.

My daughter is 10.  She's not getting a phone any time soon.

AskParents,social media age restriction Australia,How do you feed children “normally” when you have a history of disordered eating and a medically restricted diet?,"Hello parents! 

I’m currently waiting to try for my first and in the interim I’m consuming a decent amount of parenting content both on social media and in books/real life.

I have a long history of problems with food and PCOS which makes my relationship with food even more complicated. I’m realizing that I have no idea what children should be eating on a day to day basis.

I followed Kids Eat in Color (Facebook, Instagram, blog, probably more) and it REALLY helped with every question I had regarding food. Highly recommend it!
---
I think it's important to realize that kids have different nutritional needs than adults and carbs are a nutritional need for them. And also that them having a good relationship with food is important, so there are no bad foods or good foods. They are going to have their own food preferences so you have to have flexibility. And it's best to not obsess about it. Basically you do the best you can, and try to offer protein,  fat, fiber, and some kind of carb at meals but don't overcomplicate it.
---
Not a parent but grew up w an eating disorder and one thing I wanna comment on is to make your kids TRY new things, but don't force them to eat things they hate, it's good to have ""safe foods"" especially for kids that have sensory issues like I did. Trust me, it won't make them less picky it'll just make them sick have a bad relationship with food. Everyone said i hated vegetables and anything healthy but really they just didn't listen to what I DID like (Ex. broccoli makes me gag but I love spinach)
---
I don’t know if this answers your question.. 

I feed my kids what we’re eating. My youngest is very picky so I always make something that’s a safe food for him, even if it’s yam fries or chicken nuggets to be served beside the green curry or whatever we’re having. Our food is always available for him to see and smell and taste if he wants. We don’t put any pressure on him, it just backfires. 

My diet is very restricted because I have ulcerative colitis which causes me to be intolerant to a lot of foods. I just make sure to serve balanced meals. We don’t call food good or bad or junk or healthy. We talk about how food gives us energy and helps us grow. 

My 4 year old is obsessed with the idea of growing so we made a food group sticker chart. He gets so excited for getting all the food groups in one day because he thinks it means he will grow a little bit only on days he gets all the food groups. 

It’s got him motivated to try more foods. If he refuses a vegetable that day he asks for one he likes so he can get that food group.

AskParents,young people and social media ban,How do I kick out someone else’s kid?,"So my adult daughter lives at home while attending college because she’s smart af and isn’t going to pass up free rent. About five or six months ago she asks if her boyfriend (19) can stay with us for a few weeks because he needs to leave his parents’ place and has nowhere else to go.

This kid’s mom has severe mental illness and personality disorders that makes her a direct threat to this kid’s physical and emotional well-being. We know what’s been going on in that house so of course we said “sure”. 

We had met him a few times. Let’s call him Jim. My husband sets up some rules when it becomes apparent he’s going to be here longer than a couple of weeks. He was given a list of chores and the guideline of, do two hours of work a day and that’ll be your room and board and a hundred bucks a week. He did this for a few weeks, then fell off, doing a few loads of dishes per week, maybe sweeping the kitchen. He no longer gets paid but we haven’t kicked him out.

When he came he had no identification with which to get a job. I was working on getting that straightened out for him when his sibling snuck into their mom’s room and “stole” the birth certificate she’d been withholding. So we’re like, hooray, get a job! 

We quickly learned that Jim is pretty damaged. On top of the CPTSD and its resultant learned helplessness he had diabetes for who knows how long until he almost died and had to be hospitalized. Kidneys aren’t so hot, his heart has damage, and his eyesight is atrocious even with glasses, in one eye he had a cataract surgery go wrong, he can’t see to read anymore, it’s super bad and will never improve.

There’s no way this kid is going to get a job without a social worker’s intervention. 

I’m trying to get him to start rounding up medical records to get him on disability but he isn’t coming through, I doubt he’s making an effort. 

This isn’t laziness, this is a really damaged young man having intense trauma reactions when he doesn’t know how to do something, doesn’t do it right, or just plain can’t see to do it. I’ve seen it and I recognize it and it breaks my heart but I’m not a therapist. I’m not a social worker. I’m a mom with one kid in college and my own grad school on the horizon and another kid going to college or trade school in three years.  

I don’t know what to do. I’m not going to put him on the street, my god that boy would be such easy prey. But I don’t know how to get an adult whose disability isn’t yet documented into the system to get him help. (I’m in the US, btw.) I can feel my daughter growing tired of sharing her room (we don’t have another bedroom), and feeding and housing and generally caring for another kid indefinitely was not in our plans when we made our budget.

Education,young people and social media ban,OneSchool Global HQ raided by Australian Tax Office,"**Fleecing the flock: Exclusive Brethren businesses raided by Tax Office**  
  
The politically connected sect known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church preaches a “hatred” for the world. Women are treated as second-class citizens and homosexuality is not tolerated.  
  
By Michael Bachelard  
  
MARCH 23, 2024  
  
The Australian Tax Office conducted an extraordinary unannounced raid this week on the global headquarters of businesses run by the conservative Christian sect the Exclusive Brethren searching for evidence of misuse of funds by high-net-worth individuals in the church.  
  
Global leader and Sydney-based “Man of God” Bruce D. Hales had travelled overseas at the time of the raid, but former members of his flock believe he has returned to hold meetings this weekend.  
  
The sect, now known as the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (PBCC), is a closed organisation which preaches a “hatred” for people outside the church. Women are treated as second-class citizens and homosexuality is not tolerated.  
  
Its followers, known to each other as “saints”, believe Hales is “so close to the Lord Jesus that he can feel his heartbeat”.  
  
Hales, who travels the world in a $20,000 per hour private jet, tells his flock to “charge the highest price to the worldly people” – including governments and other businesses – in a doctrine known as “spoiling the Egyptians”. In 2002 he preached: “The world is there for our using up of it … the world is there to take what we want from it, and leave everything we don’t want. Spoil the Egyptians as quick and as fast as you can.”  
  
Starting on Tuesday, Australian Tax Office officials swept into an address in the “Precinct” in Herb Elliott Avenue in the Sydney suburb of Olympic Park, and raided the head offices of a number of Brethren-run companies and its school system, **OneSchool Global.** Investigators confiscated documents, computers, phones and other material.  
  
The ATO declined to comment on the raid, saying it could not discuss details of the tax affairs of any individual or entity. However, a document obtained by this masthead shows the raid was an “access without prior notice” visit run by the ATO’s Private Wealth – Behaviours of Concern section, which is within its Wealth program.  
  
A senior staff member of the Brethren’s “parent company”, Universal Business Team, or UBT, downplayed the raid in a note to staff as the organisation “working with the ATO to support with a regular audit”.  
  
But ATO documentation confirms it conducts access without prior notice raids “only in exceptional circumstances including suspected tax evasion, fraud, secrecy or concealment, and where we have a reasonable belief that documents may be disposed of, altered or destroyed”.  
  
This masthead has also learned that businesses in Goulburn whose owners run the Brethren’s public-facing charity, the Rapid Relief Team, were also raided by the Tax Office on Tuesday.  
  
Church spokesman and Melbourne businessman Lloyd Grimshaw said the church “does not operate any businesses or occupy offices at the location where the ATO has visited”, but added there were “a lot of members of our church, including senior members, who work really hard to build profitable businesses”.  
  
He did not answer a question about whether the church would co-operate with the Tax Office investigation.  
  
A spokesperson for UBT said the company had “always sought to abide by the rules set by Australian Taxation Office, and of course we are cooperating fully with their current information gathering process.”  
  
This masthead has spoken to six former members of the religion who believe the Tax Office investigation was examining what the church calls its “ecosystem” – a complex web of interwoven businesses and tax-free entities including charities and schools. The sources cannot be identified because they fear retribution against their families who are still inside the sect.  
  
The MySchool website shows that between government funding of about $40 million last year as well as millions in tax-exempt donations from the flock and its attached businesses, each Brethren student’s education is funded at between $30,000 and $50,000.  
  
However, they are prevented by their religion from going to university, and young Brethren women are destined, after a short stint in family businesses, to be married with children.  
  
  
**The Plymouth Brethren Christian Church**  
The church, which began in the 1800s in the UK but is now led by Hales from Sydney, preaches a radical doctrine of separation from “worldly” people. The doctrine allows its Brethren members to do business, but they are forbidden from eating, drinking or socialising with their non-Brethren neighbours.  
  
They are also banned from listening to radio or watching television and their access to the internet is strictly controlled by one of the companies raided this week, the Universal Business Team.  
  
But the church and its members have donated to and extensively lobbied conservative governments internationally, most famously campaigning actively for the re-election of the Howard government in 2004 while trying to conceal their involvement. They work hard to keep political donations secret.  
  
They have also been highly successful at winning government contracts, including recently lucrative contracts for the supply of COVID tests.  
  
A Brethren man can never be subservient to a woman, which means no woman can be an executive. A senior international business executive, speaking on the basis of anonymity, said this has made it increasingly difficult for Brethren companies to pitch work to clients with diversity requirements.  
  
The doctrine of separation also means that members who step out of line on either religious or financial matters can be excommunicated. Former member Craig Stewart said he had lost his family, home and business when he was “withdrawn from”. Recently, the fact that his father died was kept from him and the rest of the Brethren congregation for almost four weeks.  
  
“The normal PBCC funeral service was not held and my father’s body was secretly taken an hour away, from Katoomba to Penrith, and buried. His resting place beside my mother, his wife of over 60 years, is empty,” Stewart said.  
  
Stewart, who runs a Facebook page “Exclusive Brethren / PBCC the truth about Bruce D Hales”, said the church had also held special prayer meetings to pray for his “removal from this earth”. “My sons and grandsons, down to as young as five, are praying for my demise because I have publicly spoken out about the practices in the PBCC under Bruce Hales,” he said.  
  
Ben Woodbury, another former member, said he left because he was gay, which made living in the church “the most traumatic thing in my life to date”. He was later excommunicated.  
  
“I live a very peaceful life now and sometimes the juxtaposition between my two lives, inside the Brethren and out – I feel like a foreigner in my own country. It was so toxic.”  
  
He said church leaders had told him his only option was to become a “straight converted Christian man”, which would involve “total submission to our brother, Bruce Hales, and to the Lord and Christ”.  
  
Woodbury is known as u/excultboy on TikTok and has posted about his experiences. “I used to get a happy birthday text from my mum every year ... and now I’ve gone public, they’ve been told not to have anything to do with me at all,” he said.  
  
**The ecosystem**  
The purpose of the PBCC’s “ecosystem”, as stated in internal documents sighted by this masthead, is to “maintain the Community’s lifecycle”, but particularly to provide funding for the Brethren’s schools which are reserved for the church’s students.  
  
Ordinary Brethren individuals and businesses are strongly encouraged to spend their money with companies run by the church leaders, such as consulting firm Universal Business Team (UBT).  
  
Documents produced for a recent “Strive” forum to advertise these projects to the PBCC’s flock say UBT turns over up to $500 million a year. The profits, according to the documents, are “invested in” 124 Plymouth Brethren schools and other charities such as public-facing charity the Rapid Relief Team.  
  
But one insider, speaking on condition of anonymity for his own safety, said the commercial enterprises appeared to make considerably more money than was distributed to the charities.  
  
“I think the Tax Office will be looking at where all the money actually goes.”  
  
The insider said UBT charges Brethren businesses between $30,000 and $150,000 for two hours of consulting, but most of the consultants are working for free “thinking they’re doing it for the testimony of Bruce Hales”, meaning the gross profits of the business were about 80 per cent.  
  
In the recent “Strive” forum the ecosystem’s purpose was said to be “striving towards securing our financial future so we can fund our way of life, indefinitely”. UBT, whose offices were raided, is described in the documents as “our parent company”.  
  
“Our leadership team comprises members of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church and professionals from the wider community,” the documents say.  
  
It is also the central company from which members rent phones and computers. These are fitted with Brethren approved software, including a program called Streamline 3 which means UBT administrators can monitor the browsing history and GPS location of Brethren members and remotely capture images of their screen.  
  
**The charities**  
One of the charities funded by the ecosystem, the Rapid Relief Team (RRT), is described by Woodbury as an attempt to rehabilitate the Brethren’s poor global reputation, and to help its lobbying of politicians.  
  
In a recent Brethren conference, Strive 23, one of the Rapid Relief Team’s aims for the year was that: “Every locality to engage with a person of influence or status at a local level”.  
  
Woodbury, a former Rapid Relief Team volunteer, said it seemed to be a “cleverly co-ordinated PR instrument” of the church.  
  
Other charities are set up, some with tens or hundreds of millions of dollars of funds, with the ability to give loans for housing, to fund Brethren travel for religious meetings, and to help the Brethren poor. Though many are constituted to help the “general community in Australia”, the only beneficiaries are members of their own church.  
  
The Brethren are also establishing their own supermarkets, Campus and Co. Many stores are based on the school grounds and they are staffed by unpaid Brethren women and charge a premium to the flock for their groceries. Brethren members are expected to make a certain percentage of their weekly purchases through Campus and Co.  
  
It is dangerous for PBCC members to question their leaders on these matters, or to fail to comply with orders, because the punishment for questioning the Man of God can include being “withdrawn from” – excommunicated.  
  
Bruce Hales, who has led the church since his father died in 2003, has become increasingly wealthy in recent years, as have his sons.  
  
In 2022, this masthead reported that Gareth Hales bought a two-hectare, $9.5 million house in the NSW holiday destination of Dural, set behind a gated entry with a tennis court, heated swimming pool and a golf driving range.  
  
A few months earlier, Nerolie Hales, the wife of Dean, spent $7.5 million buying a 4116 square metre home in Epping, in Sydney’s north-western suburbs. And another senior Brethren man, Gavin Grace, of Ballarat, broke the Dural house price record, paying $14 million for a resort-style mansion, which he bought without a mortgage.  
  
**COVID contracts**  
The New Daily reported last year that Gareth and Charles Hales were suppliers for more than $1 billion worth of contracts for COVID-19 personal protective equipment in the UK via Unispace Global Limited, and Dean Hales was linked to a network of companies that won more than $30 million in government contracts to supply COVID tests to Australian governments.  
  
And a Brethren company, Westlab Pty Ltd, owned by another senior Brethren man, Gavin Grace, won tenders with the Department of Health between August 2020 and August 2022 worth a combined $106 million to supply rapid antigen tests.  
  
Bruce Hales, who is an accountant, was listed as the “independent auditor” on Westlab’s accounts.

Parenting,social media age restriction Australia,Thoughts on teens and having social media,"I (31f) have two boys 14 and 11 (12 next month). My husband has a blue collar overnight job and I a sahm so most of the parenting and caring for the kids has always been my sole job in our household. Both have cell phones. Originally my husband and I said 12 is a good/ reasonable age to get them phones, but my December baby started middle school before then so the rule is now when starting middle school they can have a phone (we also have a 9yo daughter). Their friends that they’ve grown up with in school got phones in elementary and I just could never get on board with an 8/9/10yo having a cell phone so when they begged and pleading I was the bad guy for saying no. Okay, I’ll take it. 
This change was for my comfort, so I could make sure to keep location tracking on and if god forbid there was an “incident” I would be able to reach them and get them to safety because I have a lack of trust in law enforcement since Uvalde happened. We knew when they got phones they would want to use sites that their friends use (Snapchat, Facebook, instagram) eventually, I understand that the new generation is very social online. But I also recognize the dangers of it and have told my kids that a conversation would need to be had about it to discuss the dangers of it, how to be safe on there, cyberbullying etc. Both of my boys recently (in the last year) violated that rule and broke trust. My older son is generally more calm and reasonable than my middle child, so when I doled out his “punishment” it resulted in some extra chores and him pouting for a couple days without his phone. We had a long conversation about it and I told him if he wants to keep his instagram it needs to be on private and I need to be able to see the page, and he needs to be honest with me if he gets any weird messages or people trying to follow him that he doesn’t personally know. I told him I don’t feel comfortable with him having Snapchat or Facebook because those are more dangerous. I haven’t had any issues with it since then.

Now to the issue. My middle child has a mind of his own. He’s very free spirited and sometimes impulsive, but he’s also a bit of a follower and does/says things that mirror his friends behavior for the sake of being cool (idfk). Keep in mind, I’m not super invasive, I don’t go thru their phones daily, or even weekly because I believe in respecting their privacy and their personal belongings. I verbally pry to know what’s going on in their lives because teenage boys do not think their mom is cool enough to talk to anymore I guess, and I do have access to their phone passwords and emails. I had one of my streaming accounts attached to middle child’s email and needed to reset the password so I log in and I see emails from twitter and facebook. I click on the twitter email and sure enough, it’s a post of some woman promoting her “spicy” account, and it says “people you follow”. So of course this prompted a thorough phone check, and I found him on twitter, Facebook, and Snapchat all behind our back. He said a friend told him about girls “photos” on twitter and he got “curious”, okay sure buddy. He felt very ashamed, cried and apologized. I told him I don’t see him differently and I’m not judging him for making a mistake, and that I also understand it’s a part of growing up and he will come across those things even if he’s not actively looking for it so I keep those apps off limits for that reason. I told him that pornography is not okay for a boy his age or even his brothers age, and it can have damaging effects on his little mind. I’m not against pornography, but for my teenage boys absolutely. I don’t want them thinking that it’s realistic, because these *are* paid actors. 

So this all went down over the summer and the result of this was heavy restrictions on what he can access on the phone. I set screen time limits that restrict the web browser, apps rated over 13+, and the phone locks at 10pm because shocker, he’s on that damn thing when he’s supposed to be sleeping for school. Recently he brought up wanting to have instagram and I just don’t see the point in it at all. It’s a hard no for Facebook, Snapchat, and now twitter. He communicates with his friends on texts, FaceTime, and Xbox chat so I don’t understand what he’s lacking and why he feels like he needs social media.

I am a teen mom. I had my oldest at 17 and have very little familial support other than my husband and two sisters. I don’t have a lot of confidence in my parenting, I’m honestly just winging it so I need outside opinions. I want to hear father’s perspectives because I’ve never been a boy and I know there’s a huge difference in raising boys vs girls. I want to hear teens perspectives on what they feel is fair. As well as moms, I need mom support because I don’t know what I’m doing 😅 I’ve talked to my therapist about it to get her perspective too, but I just want to hear from other parents and kids personal experiences as well and make educated decisions. I have a tendency to be a helicopter mom because I was a neglected child so I’ve had to assess that and work on it in therapy. My boys have told me I’m being overbearing about not letting them have social media so i don’t know what to think. Help please 😬 
Also if we could keep the teen mom shaming to a minimum, that’d be great. I’m sensitive, I will cry. Also he’s 14 so there’s nothing I can do about it at this point.

AskAnAustralian,young people and social media ban,A fun/social part time job,"So Im an international student, but being terminally online granted me a native english level. Now, I wanted to make some friends while working, so I decided to try out to work at maccas. Unfortunately, the shifts sucks and im getting like 2 shifts a week, which is somply not sustainable. While I hope I start getting more shifts after christmas is over, I need to look for another job anyways in case my situation stays like this.

While pay is important, conmuting and socialization also matter a lot to me, since while I had a relatively well paying job before this one, the conmute was around 2 hours, and it was those jobs were everyone just goes to do their own shit by themselves, and it was slow and painful.

So basically, what do you think are some good part time jobs where you can also make some friends or just talk to people? I personally was thinking about bartendering, but I just turned 18 a couple months ago so I feel like I might be too young? If it also pays well it would be a nice addon.

But also, for these kinds of jobs it’s actually a bit more dependant on on who you work with and the atmosphere of the workplace. You could work at a different maccas and have a much more positive experience. You could work in a bar with really grumpy people.

So I’d just apply at a bunch of different places and try your luck.

I bartended at 18. Why would you be too young to do it when you’re a legal adult? 

Hospitality is definitely the area I’d recommend if you want a job with heavy socialisation. Australia has a minimum wage, so the pay for any casual job should basically be the same. I’m sure you could find a bar or a restaurant close enough to where you live that you wouldn’t have to commute far.

Not sure, but I've heard jobs at outdoors companies can be quite good for a more social aspect. Try macpac. 

Also maybe look into volunteering - people are there for different reasons and may be more open then a workplace.

Parenting,Albanese social media ban,just looking for advice/ insight,"Im genuinely at a loss right now. so I initially gave my 13 year old daughter a phone because she needed to be reached when leaving school and on her way home. I bought a regular phone and used google family link. It was great until she figured out how to get around the parental locks on some specific apps. instagram and some others. We had a talk, I explained that she is not to use Ig but is able house Roblox to play with her friends from school. she agreed she would not engage with strangers on Roblox. I tried to trust her. so stupid of me because now I'm basically dealing with her crying her eyes out because ive banned her from speaking to a young man she claims she met on Roblox and is engaging with on Ig. she claims she would kill herself over him.

ill explain why I'm shutting this communication down. I occasionally go through her phone and read messages to ensure she is keeping a clean conversation and is safe. upon checking I find she's on Ig and the communication with this young man is disgusting. he prompts her to call him ""daddy"" and uses phrases like  
"" what did daddy say?"" and she responds like its normal! there is sexual talk all started by him. so I sat down and explained why I was cutting communication and she basically hates me and says he's just joking. im just looking for advice. she's seems genuinely distraught and I have no.idea how to go about handling this . ive made sure he is a teen, it def appears so as most of the content are from highschool games he's playing in. she told me14 but im almost sure he's atleast 16.",5,8,loquacious_laconic28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1cavrcp/just_looking_for_advice_insight/,2024-04-23 04:30:39,"r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

The ""online friend"" could be a predator passing as a teenager, happens more than you could imagine...

No phone, no social media, and no internet, because she is clearly still too young and too naive to be online; that's what I would do and she can hate me all she wants, her safety is more important than her love.

Get her a flip phone until she earns your trust back. Also, tell her you're going to seek professional help for her saying she's going to kill herself, that's not normal
---
Predators routinely use Roblox to message children. Maybe just spend a few hours with her explaining phishing emails, fake texts, scam phone calls, scams on the street, pick pockets, talk to her about bank machine devices, and fake money. Get her sceptical brain in gear she’s a smart kid right. Then watch  child safe documentary about dangers of online communication and fake children online. Just so her brain is in skeptical mode. There’s a good podcasts out there like ‘the perfect scam’ and ‘darknet diaries’. Because we raise kids to be trusting and nice, and take things at face value. But maybe it’s time she’s old enough to be more careful. I never got any of this information growing up, today it’s so bad their is scammers who take your CV off a job website and pretend to want to employ you to get your financial details. 
She’s smart she just needs to know more
About it, and explaining it to her as if she’s an adult, will help more. Also take
The users name who messaged her and give it a google, maybe others have reported it.

Personally I’d say she is grounded for an amount of time from any sort of social media or video game that can access internet. If she is continuing to talk in appropriately to this teen or man (you never know online) then she isn’t mature enough for social media imo.

teenagers,kids off social media,Can we all just wake up? The internet is rotting our brains.,"Okay disclaimer obviously im on the internet right now. I fully admit im a hypocrite sometimes and im trying to work on my internet usage too. I in fact deleted youtube and instagram a few days ago and have only ever briefly had TikTok. The only time of social media I have now is Snap (bc one specific friend doesnt have a phone number) discord for no reason and reddit. I am a firm believe that despite the good things about the internet and social media its downfalls are just too steep.
  Nobody wants to go out anymore?? Have you noticed? Maybe its just my friends of the few. But I feel like nobody wants to go do stuff everybody would rather stay home on their phones. Even when I do pull people out to do something half the time they are glued to their phones I cant stand it. Its worse when I catch myself being like that. The pandemic paired with never playing with friends outside as a little kid or even being aloud to walk to the store because of “stranger danger” means my social anxiety is horrible I get stressed out in stores even though I like getting out of the house a lot.

 I want to get rid of social media at least besides a few stuff but it makes me feel out of the loop and people shy away from me when I tell them my opinions about it. Maybe they dont relate or just dont know what to talk about besides internet brain rot.

Please get off your phones a live a little. Even if your like me and nobody around you wants to do that with out go out by yourself, ik a lot of parents wont allow it idk what to tell you there.

teenagers,kids off social media,How I overcame Doomscrolling,"I've always had the bad habit of scrolling endlessly in social medias like tiktok, reddit, youtube and more but mainly it was tiktok. This habit started when the pandemic was happening and it got worse overtime. It was really affecting my sleep, my productivity, my mental health and I even started skipping classes because of it. I knew I had to stop but it was difficult especially since I don't really have anything going on for me. 

One day on a Friday night I was lying down in bed, covering myself in my blanket,  lights closed, scrolling on tiktok and my fingers flickering video after video. I told myself I will stop after 10 minutes and go to sleep, but as usual those 10 mins turned into 30 mins, then turned into 1 hour and so on and so forth until it got to midnight.

I was getting drowsy and my eyes were getting heavy. I remember looking at the time in my phone, it was 2:20 and I promised myself I would stop in 2 mins and finally sleep. I looked at the time again and it got to 2:22, I thought to myself that I would scroll just 5 more times, but just as I was about to scroll, I felt an odd sensation. I couldn't move my thumb nor my hand nor any part of my body. I was panicking and I tried to flail arms, wiggling my toes or move any part of my body, but all I could do was close and open my eyes.  
  
I calmed myself down and had the idea that if I sleep and wake up then maybe I would be able to move again and that that this was just a one time thing. So I closed my eyes with my phone still on my hand, replaying the last video until it stopped and turned off. Then I felt my bed shake. I opened my eyes and I still couldn't move. Then, I heard it. A faint, shuffling sound coming from beneath my bed. My heart was rapidly beating and I was sweating. I looked at my phone screen and at the reflection I saw, a shadowy figure slowly rising behind me. It had long hair covering its face, limbs long and gaunt, skin pale and mottled. Even if I couldn't see the eyes, I felt it boring into me. It started getting close to me while it had a grin on its face.

I was trembling inside, I wanted to move, I wanted to scream but I couldn't. As it was getting closer I could feel the heat and I could see its face getting clearer and more detailed in the reflection. I closed my eyes out of fear and I was still trying to move.

Then I bolted upright, gasping for air, realizing I could move I quickly ran out of my room, not looking back. I went to the kitchen and I was catching my breath. I read a clock and it was 5am in the morning. I waited there until it was bright out and went to back to my room. I looked around to find that thing, I even looked under my bed and fortunately I saw nothing. My mom saw me up and said in a sarcastic tone ""Wow you're up early"".  
  
 I haven't told anyone about this story but after that night I couldn't sleep in my own room for awhile, so I slept with my parents like a kid (they were weirded out). Whether this experience was a product of sleep paralysis or something far more sinister, it was enough to break my bad habit for good. I limited myself from scrolling endlessly through social media and I got a gym membership and started going out more.

Some days later I finally went back to my room, filled with an eerie, muffled tune. Out of nowhere a freaking toilet appeared with a head coming out of the bowl and told me I was mogged and that I had negative rizz. I didn't know what to do but I was frozen.

Western Australia made Anthony Albanese prime minister in 2022 and will vote to keep him in office only if the Albanese government honours what economist Saul Eslake calls “the worst Australian public policy decision of the 21st century” – and predictably Labor is honouring the deal.

The politics and economics of the west as they shape the Federation get virtually no attention in the east – yet they are critical to the nation’s unity and social compact and, in recent times, pivotal to who becomes prime minister.

There is one certainty. Within the Federation the power of the west is rising. The rise has been basic to the fate of both Scott Morrison and Albanese and who governs in Canberra. During the pandemic WA premier Mark McGowan ran the politics of separation to keep his state largely Covid free and became the most popular leader in Australian history.

Leaders change but the power realities stay the same. Last December Treasurer Jim Chalmers announced that national cabinet – the Prime Minister and premiers – had agreed on more support for the struggling National Disability Insurance Scheme with the trade-off that the federal government would continue to honour the GST distribution deal negotiated in 2018 by Morrison when he was treasurer.


That deal is primarily about the west. It is probably unprecedented in Australian history. It is driven by political power, the power of a GST deal to shape the results of WA seats in federal elections. The deal negotiated by Morrison was bipartisan; under Chalmers it remains bipartisan. It is a special arrangement that delivers huge financial support to the richest state. Neither Labor nor the Coalition like to discuss what’s happening.

That riles independent economists Eslake and Chris Richardson, who have separately reached the same conclusion and campaign against what they condemn as a disastrous public policy with no redeeming features. “This represents a transfer of almost $40bn to the government of the richest state in Australia,” Eslake tells Inquirer. “A state that is richer than the rest of Australia by a vastly larger margin than any other state has ever been, so the citizens of that state can enjoy better public services and lower levels of state taxation than the citizens of the rest of Australia.”

Richardson tells Inquirer: “This deal is not about protecting widows and orphans. It is about funnelling money to the best-off state in the nation. If you are worried about Australia’s social compact, whether we have got this right, and if you’re looking for the dumbest thing we do, this is the stand-out.”

Making clear that the west will not tolerate any change, state Treasurer Rita Saffioti says Albanese Labor will risk losing “every seat in WA” if it reneges on the GST deal. Not a bad threat as threats go. But it’s not necessary, since Albanese and Chalmers are on board.

Saffioti’s threat, however, is beneficial. It confirms what the entire saga is about – West Australian seats. Richardson says of the threat: “It goes to the raw politics. We’re robbing the nation blind and you can’t stop us now.” Being fair to Chalmers, he pledges a Productivity Commission inquiry into the GST arrangements in 2026, yet Morrison’s initial decision drew on a PC inquiry, admittedly with loaded terms of reference.

Quizzed about the initial GST deal, Malcolm Turnbull justifies the decision: “There are a lot of things that work in theory from an economic point of view, but they don’t fly in political terms.” How important was the deal to Turnbull’s future given his narrow 2016 majority? “We’d have lost almost every seat in that state (WA) without it,” he says. In short, the GST deal was a survival necessity.

But it was Morrison, as prime minister in 2019, who became the beneficiary of the deal he had done as treasurer. In Morrison’s 2019 election win, he retained all the government’s seats in WA. In the west, the politics of the GST distribution extend statewide and have a statewide impact.

Turnbull recalls that when doing the deal Morrison had a row with then Tasmanian treasurer Peter Gutwein. A concerned Turnbull asked Morrison: did you use the F-word? Morrison conceded he had used the M-word. What’s this more terrible M-word, Turnbull asked. “Mendicant,” said Morrison. All was revealed.

Morrison rejects the critique of the deal made by the economists – on both financial and political grounds. “This guarantee was never a permanent arrangement,” he tells Inquirer. “It was a time-limited arrangement. It was a transition. Under the old system some states were receiving gains from a model that was out of date with Australia’s modern economy.”

The origins of the west’s deal lie deep in our history. Hardly any schoolchildren in the east know that in 1933 the people of the west voted by referendum to secede from the federation, a step thwarted by Britain. Few people grasp that we still live with the consequences.

The government of Joe Lyons authorised the Commonwealth Grants Commission to provide “impartial and independent” advice on the distribution of grants to the states, the upshot being the commission’s 1936 report that grants reflect an equity principle to enable states to deliver similar levels of government services.

When the GST was created these principles were refined as the basis of distribution to the states. For much of the 20th century WA, given its small population over a vast area, was a beneficiary getting extra funds along, of course with Tasmania. But the west was transformed by the various stages of the mining and resources boom.

Eslake adopts an infamous Paul Keating line, saying the west got “kissed on the arse by a rainbow”. Of course, it’s unfair, given the WA resources sector is Australia’s most globally successful industry. But it captures the scale of transformation; the west, long one of the weakest financial states, is now the financial powerhouse of the Federation. Its scale is unrecognised.

That may be a good or bad thing. Eslake’s analysis is that the west’s per capita gross state product is running at more than 60 per cent above the national average over the past three years – that’s up from a modest 7 per cent above the national average at the turn of the century.

He tells Inquirer: “To the best of my knowledge there has never been another time, at least not since Federation, when one state has been richer – as measured by per capital gross product – than the rest of the country by as large a margin as Western Australia has been in recent years.”

By way of comparison, Eslake says during the past 45 years the ACT’s per capita gross product has never been more than 24 per cent above the national average; history suggests Victoria’s has never been more than 12 per cent above and NSW never more than 8 per cent above the national average.

A student of Federation and a loyal Tasmanian, Eslake – who returned after three decades on the mainland to live outside Hobart in his beloved island state – has despatched his analysis to the federal Treasury. It shows, among other things, the value of the west’s iron ore production has risen from just $3.7bn in 1999-2000 to an average of $111bn a year in the past six years.

He says the iron ore price rose to over $US100 a tonne by the end of 2009, stayed above that level until mid-2014, fell to a low of just over $US40 a tonne at the end of 2015, but then rose again and has been above $US100 a tonne for most of the time since June 2020. In addition, there has been a vast increase in the volume of WA’s mineral and energy production since 2010.

Given its financial strength, WA’s share of the GST funds then fell sharply. The west highlighted its complaint – saying it was getting “less than 30c in the dollar” of GST revenues it contributed. The lament of unfairness and being “ripped off” by the east was ritualised by the local media. Morrison, a highly political treasurer, responded. Morrison’s deal put a floor under the relativity of each state to guarantee its proportion of GST revenue would not be less than 70 per cent, and then 75 per cent, of what it would receive under an “equal per capita” distribution. The floor, of course, was only relevant for the west. It was a deal for WA.

But if WA got more, it meant the other states got less – a disaster. So Morrison agreed to “top up” the GST pool so that, until 2026-27, no state or territory would be worse off. In short, WA was the big winner, there were no losers and the federal government – or the Australian people – picked up the extra bill. The national interest was the loser.

It was initially estimated to cost the federal budget $8.2bn across eight years; Eslake now estimates it has blown out to $39.2bn across 11 years and “could end up being as much as $50bn”. That’s because the higher commodity prices, the richer is WA, the more the commonwealth must contribute to honour the 70 and 75 per cent in the dollar WA pledge.

As prime ministers, Turnbull, Morrison and Albanese have all signed up. The motive in each case has been the same – seeking to hold or win WA federal seats.

In truth, the politics of the GST distribution is diabolical. That’s because the model – based on giving and taking – institutionalises winners and losers by its design.

That’s why Morrison adopted the “no worse off” extra funding provision. It was a political necessity. This harks back to one of Turnbull’s replies to his critics: the job of government is not to follow economic purism but to find solutions that work for governments and people.

Morrison tells Inquirer: “The way the GST distribution had been working was indefensible. Western Australia was put in a ridiculous position. The idea that you could have a state getting less than 70c in the dollar from the GST distribution was unfair. That was undeniable.” This is Morrison speaking as a political realist. He says there are limits to how far a state can be penalised because of its financial strength. He says he sought not just a better deal for the West but a better distribution system overall.

However, Eslake and Richardson have had enough. Lacking any political power, they use the weight of argument to highlight the financial and equity anomalies embedded in this bipartisan compact with the west.

“We’re wasting a lot of money on the NDIS but at least it’s a noble cause,” Richardson says. “This is an enormous amount of money being spent, not on a noble cause but on a political stitch-up. It’s a backroom deal. This is the biggest amount of money we are spending on what achieves the least for Australia.”

Turnbull says: “Delivering durable GST reform was, and will remain, a long-term asset for the Coalition in WA.” Well, that depends. Now, it is an indispensable asset for the Albanese government in WA but there is no certainty it will suffice for Albanese in the west at the next election.

Eslake says the initial cost of the “no worse off” guarantee was predicated on the assumption that iron ore prices would fall back to and remain at $US55 a tonne – meaning that in turn the guarantee wouldn’t cost the budget too much. He says that with the federal budget now in structural deficit – despite its current, transitionary surplus – the federal government presides over a transfer of almost $40bn to the WA government, “the only government in Australia, and one of the few in the world, which is running and expects for the foreseeable future to run persistent budget surpluses – so that they can run even bigger ones”.

He says: “How that can be reconciled with any serious concept of equity, let alone fiscal prudence, is surely beyond comprehension.”

Eslake says the distribution of revenue from the GST is the “largest single expenditure program in the federal budget”. It totals $92.5bn in the 2013-24 budget, far above the cost of the Age Pension or the NDIS. He accepts the principle at work – the stronger states support the weaker states in the cause of delivering the goal of government services equality. His objection is to the WA redistrib­ution

Asked about the scale of the policy failure, he says: “I would say it is a corruption, not in the NSW police force sense but a corruption relating to the biggest spending program in the federal budget.

“The principle here, that it shouldn’t matter where you live to determine your access to health and education, that principle goes back to the 1930s. That’s when it was first promulgated by the Grants Commission in the aftermath of the referendum in Western Australia. It should be upheld.”

The story of the impact of the west on national politics is heavily tied to Morrison. One of his most disastrous decisions – perhaps the most fatal he made as prime minister – was initially to back Clive Palmer’s High Court challenge to the pandemic-induced border closure by McGowan. McGowan tried to dissuade him, but only too late did Morrison realise the damage and withdraw from the challenge. But he had given Albanese his campaign: that Morrison wanted to sabotage the closed border that kept the west safe from Covid.

Albanese is Prime Minister today courtesy of the west, where he won four seats to deliver his one seat 2022 election victory. Morrison’s success in the west at the 2019 election, when he held 11 of the 16 seats, turned into ashes at the 2022 election.

WA is now the strongest fiscal state in the nation. Indeed, most West Australians are proud of this fact. They have every reason to be proud. It is also a fact WA governments, McGowan in the lead, have extracted huge benefits for their state. That, after all, is the job of a premier. McGowan, in retrospect, shouldn’t be criticised. His achievements were extraordinary.

Asked why he was campaigning to unwind the GST deal when both major parties supported it, Eslake says: “Until three weeks ago both major parties supported the stage three tax cuts and now neither of them does.

“The Prime Minister’s defence against the charge he had broken a promise – which he has done – is that circumstances around the stage three tax cuts had changed dramatically since they were legislated. But haven’t the circumstances around this issue also changed dramatically?” Eslake points to the cost explosion in the policy and the fact the federal budget, expected back in 2019 to be heading into surplus, is now projected to be in a long-run structural deficit. They constitute a significant change in circumstances.",5,27,persistenceoftime90,https://www.theaustralian.com.au/inquirer/the-heavy-price-of-keeping-the-west-happy/news-story/28c50cb1340ff4d44984a09c4523314b,2024-02-17 07:20:40,"**Greetings humans.**

WA is a good example of what Australia could be like if public services were truly well funded.

Never mind that Victoria and nsw quarantine their pokies revenue from the gst calculations…

Can someone please tell me how the size of GST collection compares to size of the economy in WA vs other states?  With the export focus, the GST collection will be limited to the domestic goods and services and as a % of the economy, the GST take will be much lower than other states. If this is accurate then the % of GST returned to WA should be a higher % than other states.

Yeah nah, as a west Aussie we are continually forgotten by the east coast and for once they've been forced to listen because we actually matter politically and/or economically. 

Fact of the matter is, we still only get 70c on every dollar we contribute, the rest of Australia is still siphoning money from us. Maybe the east should pull themselves up by their bootstraps and contribute more to get more.",2024-02-17 07:20:40,False

I'm exhausted, I have no family help, no child support, we are in the process of getting an autism diagnosis (which will help financially for sure) but how do people do this? 
I've had to turn down/leave great career paths because schedules don't line up with daycare, which is as much as my rent(which him and I share a bedroom in our landlords house). I work 60 hours a week at my job, then pick him up and go door dashing and still am negative some months. Government aid is only available if you make under x dollars, which if I got a job making 16 an hour it would actually be a pay increase for me, because then it would cover my daycare/food/ins costs. Social life? No way. Dating? Ghosted as soon as they realize I have a kid. 

On top of all this, I'm expected to parent? To keep a positive outlook on life? I've become certified in ABA therapy because of the possible autism, even though I have no desire to do this as a career. I've completed EMDR therapy, and do talk therapy biweekly, as does my son. I take him to different waterfalls each week, or do some sort of activity outside. I'm in local parenting social media groups so he has interaction and friends outside of daycare.

I'm doing all the right things, and it's not getting better. I actively pursue new avenues and nothing alleviates the stress. And it won't get better.

privacy,social media age restriction Australia,Maintaining Privacy As A College Student Forced To Use Certain Services?,"I looked through the sub and found a few similar questions but nothing quite like what I'm looking for.  
  
I am a college student looking to improve my online privacy, will be shifting browsers, emails, VPNs, and more in the upcoming weeks, then starting the process of removing as much of my data from the internet as I can. Unfortunately, breakage has been a problem, as TOR and some other programs are blocked on my University's network.   
  
How can I maintain my privacy as a student when my university email is through Microsoft, and I am required to use it for many services that leak my data everywhere? Stuff like TEAMS, GroupMe, Slack, Box, and so much more. Hell, I am required for some classes to use a program that doesn’t disclose what it does with our data, and it watches us test through our webcam, scans our surroundings in our private homes, logs our IP addresses, and tracks our eye movements. I have to be able to use YouTube, docs, Google classroom, and other Google services for school as well. Is there a way to have the majority of my work on a private browser and have a dummy account as restricted as possible for when I must use those services?  
  
I have to use my computer daily and often am connected to public networks. I am using a basic Lenovo laptop running Windows, but I am in the market for a new laptop and am willing to learn how to use Linux or a different OS that is better for privacy. At the very least I want to harden Windows.   
  
I also use Notion for my calendar and organization, and social media to keep tabs on university and club events, my friends, and parties. I don't ever post and would be willing to part with my accounts to remake them under a different email with no identifying information and not post anything identifying. I can't get off social media entirely though because they are critical for my school and local involvement, the way that orgs communicate here. My profile would still be connected to a lot of things that would allow someone to build a profile on me.

If they don't know how to use the software the school offers and they didn't consider/care about the privacy implications of software like zoom or whatever you are using that states they collect your info the TOS, i might doubt the quality of the education your paying for. (after reading your post again, I never knew about google classroom, that sucks if that's your campus wide class room resource.)

privacy,social media age restriction Australia,One way age verification could be exploited by criminals,"I believe it is crucial to bring attention to the potential risks of age verification methods, particularly in obtaining recordings of individuals without their explicit consent. I seek to promote how actively harmful these policies are, with specific concern to the privacy and security of women.

This post will explore the potential risks associated with fraudulent age verification websites, specifically addressing their capacity to conduct unauthorized surveillance on users by webcams. This post discusses age verification methods reliant on webcams, including those involving document and biometric verification techniques.

I hope the information is clear, I am considering further elaboration on this topic in a potential future article.

One method threat actors can use is the manipulation of the Domain Name System (DNS), a system responsible for translating domain names into corresponding IP addresses. 

DNS hijacking involves a threat actor altering DNS settings to redirect users to undesired content, typically ads or an alternative search engines. This same approach is also utilized for DNS blocking, as seen in the EU, where Internet Service Providers employ it to restrict access to pirate websites, due to its efficiency and minimal collateral damage (compared to IP blocking which could block totally innocent sites).

I personally encountered a situation earlier this year where my Google Chrome browser repeatedly redirected to Bing and displayed ads for blatant drop-shipping sites. Upon investigation, I discovered that a video download extension I had installed was the source of the issue.

Whether it was inherently malicious or became compromised through acquisition or updates is anybody’s guess, however the problems ceased upon removal of the extension. I was not aware of the situation primarily because of my consistent use of a virtual privacy network, which modifies my DNS settings and likely prevented the malicious extension from redirecting me from Google to Bing or serving ads. I am sure it was a DNS hijacker and not adware due to that. 

Also In 2022, it was discovered that a browser colour modification extension exhibited similar behaviour, these extensions are out there and can be abused.

It is conceivable for threat actors to use this method, redirecting individuals attempting to access adult websites to deceptive or otherwise bogus age verification website. A threat actor could discreetly establish an innocent looking extension, purporting to provide something like local weather information or enhance website font size on websites for people with eye sight issues. Then when a user attempts to access an adult website, the extension could redirect them to a fake age verification site. Something like a fake YOTi page. 

This deceptive age verification website may coerce users into granting access to their webcam under the guise of biometric or document based age verification, enabling the unconsensual recording of the user's webcam activity, It’s a creeps dream. 

The risk of such crimes does not necessitate any downloads as well; rather, threat actors could easily establish a deceptive adult website hidden behind age verification measures. 

There is already a fake Pornhub website that exists with an obscure domain extension, it’s obviously a fake Pornhub site when you visit it. The primary purpose of this site is not data theft or deception; rather, it serves to circumvent restrictions present in certain countries such as India and Pakistan. To bypass blocks on adult websites in these regions, the content is hosted on another separate domain. 

However, obscured by an age verification page, the inherent risks associated with this website significantly increase. The website's legitimacy is unable to be verified without potentially giving it your sensitive info and allowing it access to your webcam. This situation even enables the potential for threat actors to populate a site with illegal material, waiting until a victim verifies their age and identity to then exploit them through blackmail. People won’t go to the police, people will take their lives. 

I have yet to address additional potential risks associated with these systems, such as invasive webcam surveillance akin to how Remote Administration Tools (RATS) are used now, the majority of victims being women or teenagers. 

The lobbying efforts undertaken by age verification companies in support of these policies have, in certain instances, positioned them in a manner that potentially shields them from legal or regulatory repercussions by the government.. For example, within the context of the United Kingdom, the Age Verification Providers Association, a profit oriented trade group actively involved in lobbying the government for age verification implementation, could potentially exploit their ability to withdraw from the UK jurisdiction in response to any intervention by regulatory bodies such as the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) or the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS).

This situation presents a catch 22 moment for the government, creating a situation where pursuing legal action against these entities becomes a challenging prospect. The fear of backlash from various ""children safety"" advocacy groups and campaigners could cast the government as weak towards adult websites. 

An instance highlighting this issue arose when it was disclosed that the Department of Education had shared children's information with betting firms to prevent the opening of accounts by underage individuals. Given the timeframe, it is likely that my data was included in this.

Rather than pursuing formal action against the Department of Education, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) sent their concerns through a strongly worded letter. Despite the potential risks, such as the misplacement of this data or a threat actor carrying out a data breach once they reach adulthood.

A similar response may be expected in the event that age verification companies like YOTi are implicated in recording users and selling such information to data brokers—though it’s crucial to clarify that I am not asserting YOTi’s involvement in such a scheme. However, the implementation of policies involving a severe intrusion into people’s privacy increases the likelihood of such occurrences over time.

Classic FB move. They offer music but still flag you - likely due to different licensing in certain regions. Stick to royalty-free music from sites like Epidemic Sound or Artlist to avoid the hassle.

Hey, that’s super frustrating! Facebook has a library of music they offer, but sometimes the rights aren’t fully cleared for all regions or uses, which is why you get those strikes, even if the content isn’t monetized.

For non-copyrighted music, check out sites like **Epidemic Sound** (they have a free trial), **Artlist**, or **YouTube Audio Library**. These offer royalty-free tracks that won’t give you issues later. Also, double-check the music licensing terms in Capcut and Canva just to stay safe. Keep up the great work with the soccer page!

The context is that Australia has pretty extreme mass surveillance laws, so they don't need to compromise your phone directly.

 'mandatory data retention' means that all telcos are required to keep your metadata for years, so everyone you call website you visit, when and where you connected from. The government has to request access, though, apparently.

If you want privacy on the internet, you should use a VPN, and not an Australian one, because under the ""Intercept and access act' the government can force company employees to secretly insert backdoors into tech without telling their employer.

But it's probably fine to hide in the crowd.

Hello everyone, a little question if I may.

My new employer wants me to install something on my phone to wipe it in case of loss if I want to install the work teams/outlook on it. For reference it is a big well known company where I am, not a little random company. 
In theory the request seems reasonable. I'm not required to get teams/outlook on my phone, I just like to do so. But since it's a personal phone, do I have any reason to believe they can do anything more than wipe in case of loss? Anything I should consider before agreeing even if it's the only thing they can do? (Like a potential wipe being to early and not giving me a chance of finding the phone and my personal stuff or I don't know). It's an android if that changes anything.

Thank you",2023-10-26 08:01:37,False

My approach to words with my kid is that the only bad words are words that demean people and put them down. So I don't care if she says ""What the fuck?"" but I do care if she calls somebody stupid. I think the more important thing to do is teach kids time and place for certain kinds of language, so I've had the discussion with my daughter that some words will get her in trouble at school and that it's important to know your audience.
---
Can I ask why you find those words wrong? Serious question.

I'm from culture where swearing isn't seen as bad, everyone does it. So, words that you used are genuinely confusing to me.

I will say there was one word I hated my kid using, ""savage"". It's used as a term for something great example, ""that dinner was savage"". Don't know why, but I could not stand it. I just told me kid,we don't use certain words as they can hurt some people when they hear them. This worked until my kid started school and thr teacher had to pull me aside and basically tell me to cop on as my kid was policing all the other children. Morto for myself
---
Ha. My child is 6. He is autistic and his speech has always been delayed. A lot of times he gets words wrong, but close enough that we can figure it out. 

 Lately he has been pushing boundaries and trying to say bad words. Dunno how kids figure out what the bad ones are, but whatever. My favorite one is ""shit."" He never ever gets it right. Best part is, he knows it's not quite right so he will just keep saying it a little differently, trying to find it. 

""Holy Ship, Mommy!... (Pause) Holy Shift!... (Pause) Holy Shrimp!!!""

I've tried to say that Shrimp is an adult word (I didn't want to reach him the correct one!) and that kids say ""holy Moley"" or whatever, but it just made him more excited to say shrimp!

Education,young people and social media ban,Working with Students in Outdoor Education - Thoughts on Effective Facilitation,"Are you an educator or mentor looking for ways to improve your group facilitation approach in outdoor education? 

If so, this guide may be for you. I discuss various aspects of working with students in an outdoor education setting:  
  
\- Getting to know your students

\- creating group expectations

\- guided and independent practice

\- differentiated facilitation

\- evaluation

Working with young people is a rewarding and challenging. 

As mentors, it is our responsibility to create a safe and supportive learning environment that promotes growth and development for all. In particular leading students in an outdoor setting. My personal experience as an outdoor educator adds its own flavour to academic frameworks and translates them into actionable steps.  
  
**Getting to know them as individuals.** 

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is a useful framework to keep in mind when considering the needs of your students. Basic physiological needs such as food, water, and shelter must be met before higher-level needs such as belonging, and self-esteem can be addressed. By taking the time to understand each student's background and prior experiences, we can better facilitate their meaningful learning and ensure their needs are being met.

This is key to creating a safe and respectful learning environment. Facilitating this effectively can create opportunities for student leadership and positively impact buy-in of reflection activities to help students connect with themselves, others, and the environment.

**Setting boundaries and expectations.** 

Briefings can be a useful tool for establishing a framework and communicating non-negotiables to the group. 

This can include safety concerns as well as cultural values and expectations for care of the environment. By creating a social contract with the group, we can foster a sense of collaboration and ownership among the students.   
  
**Trial and error.**

Joplin's and Kolb's learning cycles provide a useful framework for facilitating trial and error in real time. By encouraging students to take controlled risks and learn from their mistakes, we can promote growth and development. 

It is also important to allow for independence, following the guidance of scholars Raffan, Dewey, and Wattachow. By recognising that each student has something unique to contribute, we can create a space that allows for individual growth and development. Discuss these themes throughout programs and watch students contribute in amazing ways.   
  
**Engaging with the natural world and Indigenous perspectives.**

By helping students connect with the environment and each other, we can foster a sense of belonging and promote personal and collective growth. For many students nowadays, reconnecting them to outdoor environments through camp experiences is a daunting process. Here in Australia, the Indigenous peoples have a continuing connection with the land from which all can learn from. 

Help students feel competent and safe in the outdoors using teachable moments such as temperature management and where to sit. 

Reflection is another key component of this process, allowing students to develop themes such as connection to self, others, and the environment. This will naturally occur over long periods of time but for most groups going out once per year, these activities need to be structured in. Quiet time and nature diaries are both great tools for this.  
  
**Considering the diverse needs of our students.**

Use multimodal resources and teaching techniques. 

Often the most disruptive students in the classroom are the most engaged outdoors. The sensory nature of outdoor education is a great opportunity to introduce learning through experience. Such as making bird nests or learning to paddle a canoe. This way we can reach as many students as possible and promote diverse learning for all.   
  
These considerations are applicable to anyone managing a group dynamic. However, this is my experience and hence is directly applicable to people working in the outdoor sector.  
  
**Main Takeaways:**  
  
1. Get to know your students as individuals and understand their background and experiences.  
  
2. Set boundaries and expectations through briefings and establish a social contract with the group.  
  
3. Encourage trial and error through Joplin's and Kolb's learning cycles and allow for independence and individual growth.  


4. Foster a sense of belonging and promote personal and collective growth by helping students connect with the natural world and Indigenous approaches to life.  
  
5. Use reflection to develop themes such as connection to self, others, and the environment.

I think it'd be better if they didn't approach me. If no one owns a name why do you need permission? I wouldn't do this in my family. How are you going to respond if they don't like it or get upset? I think it could turn really awkward for everyone.
---
I could make an argument for either side lol. Like you said, no one owns a name and I don’t think you *need* to say anything. It’s a common name and you like it independent of her using it. But if you are quite close it might also be a little weird to use the same name as her without giving her a heads up. Maybe once you are pregnant just broach it casually and say something like “just to let you know, we’ve always loved the name Wyatt and are considering using it for the baby”. But that could open things up her to be weird about it. I personally wouldn’t care at all if a friend used one of the same names as my kids. But if you’ve spent any time at all on r/namenerds you’ll see that people can have strong feelings about these sort of things. There’s also a chance that you might change your mind once you actually meet your baby too. This is a tough one lol
---
Honestly, I can see both sides. You, the kids and the adults you've mentioned don't seem to spend much time together so maybe it wouldn't matter. 


But, if it was me, I'd be pissed. My sons name was chosen for like 10 reasons, including memorialising a childhood friend that had died. It was meaningful to both me and his dad.


I couldn't imagine a close friend or family friend having the same attachment to the name we chose. 
---
I'd like a heads up personally, and then figure out together how to address them individually when together. Not to have permission, but as a form of recognition? Like.. ""hey! I didn't forget you. Just wanted to let you know."" Kind of deal. It can be a little jarring if not addressed.

But yeah, once you are 20 weeks along or similar, just bring it up when hanging out in person. Bonus points if kid names are brought up. Explain that you and your husband have LOVED the name Wyatt for years and that it's still the #1 planned name for baby. Any ideas for nicknames for when we're hanging out?",2025-05-29 04:12:39,False

Typically if a large account gets very little traction is because the followers are fake and its been shadow banned. That's likely why the original owner sold or gave it away in the first place.

Maybe the followers are fake, they must have run a brand awareness campaign on each post to increase engagement.

SocialMedia,social media age restriction Australia,What is one the BEST places to learn to succeed on social media?,"Hello.

TLDR: I was wondering if you have any tips for places or channels to watch to increase knowledge of how to succeed on social media?

  
**Additional info:**

My main struggle is creating engaging posts for our target audience.

I've been doing the social media as a side-task now for 4 years for our business. The business sells gas detectors, gas and dust masks, fire extinguishers, courses and services.

In our marketing team, my leader usually comes up with the idea for a post, then i write the text and create the nessesary pictures.

I believe our problem is 2 things:  
\- Our target group is male aged 40-55, and 55-70+. They **rarely** like, comment, or engage with posts which makes it difficult to spark the algorythm.

\- Also, i think our followers see our posts as uninteresting, because we have lost 5% of our followers over 2024-2025. Our posts mostly consists of our services and products.",4,10,TheDeathCrafter,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/1j7wrpb/what_is_one_the_best_places_to_learn_to_succeed/,2025-03-10 11:49:34,"If this post [doesn't follow the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/about/rules/), please report it to the mods.

If you can add humor to posts, that might help your engagement.

For instance, make a Reel about a dad making dinner, with flames coming off a stove. Then showcase your fire extinguisher with something like, ""Your best friend when dad's on dinner duty.""

If you don't have production budget to film the scenes, you could probably find basic stock footage and edit it together cleverly.

Also, check out Tony LC Signs on YouTube. He splices together his videos with another video as a hook, and it's very effectual for a more ""mundane"" product.

Finally, ask ChatGPT to find other accounts in your niche and analyze which of their posts do well. That can help tell you what the audience wants to see.

Check out **Social Media Examiner**, **HubSpot Blog**, and **Neil Patel’s YouTube channel** for expert insights. For engagement, try storytelling, case studies, and problem-solving content instead of just product posts. Also, LinkedIn might work better for your audience than IG or FB

SocialMedia,social media age restriction Australia,Is my boss too demanding? -social media manager,"Hi. Long story short, I’m a college grad in my first real job. I work as a social media/marketing manager for a small real estate company. My bosses are asking too much I think. They are really strict about having a post every single day (7 days a week) and having something on our story 24/7. They say this is to increase visibility. Which, I understand to some extent, but here’s the problem: WE DONT HAVE THAT MUCH CONTENT. They expect me to pump out post after post, even though we realistically only have maybe 4 decent posts a week (usually about new listings or final sales). I don’t know what to do. They’ve complained to me our social media is “dead” even though I do try to have at least 1 story each day, and 5-7 posts a week. But the posts are easy boring posts that don’t drive engagement because they also give me a shitload of other projects to tackle like graphic designing a whole magazine for them (that’s a whole other issue). So basically I don’t have much time to brainstorm good content ideas, and the ideas I have would take time to make. I want to tell them its quality over quantity but they’re stubborn middle aged women who probably won’t listen and are just going to be upset I’m “telling them how to run their business”…even though I was hired to handle all the marketing. I really would like to make more complex posts like reels and BTS, but I can’t with the amount of other things I have to do. And even then, I wouldn’t have a post like that ALL the time. What do I do? Am I just a bad social media manager? Are their expectations too high? I don’t know.",4,33,seaelves7,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/1kel3nj/is_my_boss_too_demanding_social_media_manager/,2025-05-04 14:28:13,"If this post [doesn't follow the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/about/rules/), please report it to the mods.

It might be helpful to track your efforts and the results you're getting with the current approach. If the engagement is low despite the constant posting, you can use that data to show them it's not working.
---
Realtors are people who want people to think they are busy but they really aren't. 

Look for a new job.
---
I used to make content for a few real estate agents as a side hustle and honestly there’s so many posts you can create other than listings, such as tracking market trends (altos is a good source), things to do in _ city, home design or interior designs trends, going to local restaurants, events, etc, make the group seem like a part of the community and an expert on the area. You can use stock photos for a lot of these, it’s just putting it together in canva. Time management gets easier with time and experience!
---
The best piece of advice I’ve been given is “don’t do invisible work”-  rise to the scope of your job description and do nothing further.   RE posts are IMO more to provide realtor awareness but if they want better engagement, static posts vs the realtor becoming the face of their own brand is where I see a LOT of RE content fall flat.

Parenting,Online Safety Amendment Act 2024,Teenage daughter and her abuse,"Hi I need some advice. I have a teenage daughter who is 14. She is ADHD, possible ODD, ASD (ASD not tested as she said no because it would make her feel worse about herself, which I honoured).
Since very young she has never taken no for an answer and manipulated to get the result she wanted. She has been through a period of self harm and talking about suicide often. I had taken her for emergency psychological help a couple of times and they just told me to hide all means of being able to carry through with taking her life. I’ve checked on her every 10 minutes at times to see if she is OK in her room. 
She has been abusive to her father in particular in the past but since he left us six months ago she has slowly increased her demands of me, her authority in the household and her verbal abuse of me. She twists everything to make out her brother is the favourite when in truth he doesn’t act like her or treat me like she does so I don’t really have to tell him to stop abusing me…
Since high school she has shut me out of her life. I moved her due to bullying by a group of boys. But now she is into filming fights, swears constantly, has hit me over the head but then acted outraged when I called her out on it. 
It escalated recently when her awful friend took pictures of her from photos of when she was younger at our house and threatened to post them online. I got the blame, not the friend.
In the latest incident she called me a fkn bitch and a c*nt. I tried to remove myself from the situation and she blocked me from leaving (she is bigger than me). I sent her to her fathers. She now won’t speak to me - unless it’s to start another fight when she comes to collect something. 
She misses classes at school, yells at teachers, disrupts other classes by just walking in and sitting down. She has been threatened with expulsion. She doesn’t care, she does what she wants.
When she fell out with her father she told him his children don’t love him and that he should go and kill himself. I expect that will be said to me soon, but with me it’s more complicated because I have depression and I have had a family member take their life. I want to build a relationship with her but feel unsafe both psychologically and physically around her.
Has anyone else been in this situation and if so what did you do?

SocialMedia,young people and social media ban,I want to start a business. Should I use Social Media as a marketing tool or should I focus on quality content and word of mouth?,"Hi,

I've taken a step back from Social Media recently. Deleted my Instagram and only use Facebook once a week. However, I'm starting to blog on my own, just doing personal stuffs, without pressure.

But I have a business idea I want to work on in the coming weeks and months. I'm wondering if, when it will be nearby ready, if I should use social media as a marketing tool?

I see a lot of people leaving social media or finding out that it isn't good for mental health. So, is creating 5-10 posts a week too much for such a low visibility online? Better take that time to create meaningful content like blog, newsletters, or delivering a good product?

Where do you see digital and social media marketing in 5-10 years?

Sure, it can be a great thing for NGO, to communicate about their projects, to let us know where money goes, but for business who are selling things, I don't know anymore.

Thank you very much.",4,27,Nic727,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/1kwt4vr/i_want_to_start_a_business_should_i_use_social/,2025-05-27 17:23:03,"If this post [doesn't follow the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/about/rules/), please report it to the mods.

Social media is great for getting your business out there quickly, but good content and word of mouth help build real trust.   
  
If social feels like too much, you can focus on blogs or newsletters first and use social media just to share updates.   
  
In the next 5-10 years, social will keep changing, but people will always care about honest connections and useful content.
---
I work with different small business, and what I found it is that working with a few client is that social media can still help a business, but only if it fits your goals and doesn't drain your energy.

Focus first on building a great product or service. Then use social media more like a discovery tool. Even 1 or 2 good posts a week can be enough.

Start building an email list early. Blogs and newsletters give you direct contact without relying on algorithms.

Repurpose what you create. A blog post can become 2 or 3 short posts for social. That saves time and keeps you off the apps.

In the next 5 to 10 years, people will likely value depth and connection more. Social media will still be around, but things like communities, newsletters, and podcasts will grow.

You don’t have to be online every day. Just be consistent in a way that works for you.
---
It's great, depending on what your business/product/service is.
---
It kinda depends on what your business is, however, the short answer is absolutely. Social media is an awareness channel, so while you may not see The most revenue coming from that platform, it funnels everyone into the conversion channels. 

Here's an example from a national carpet cleaning business I run ads for:

They have multiple locations around the US, and what we've found to be consistent across all of their locations is that Meta ads make Google ads look really good. Trendlines show that the number of conversions for Google ads fluctuates with the total spend of meta ads. While that conversion data may not be showing up in Meta's platform, what happens is that people will see an ad for this company pop up a few times on their feed, and then head to google and look up ""carpet cleaning near me"", where this company pops up again. Even if they've never used it before, they are significantly more likely to click on that business because they recognize it from Facebook.

Social media is all about increasing the touchpoints between you and your ideal customer. The more touchpoints they get, the more likely they are to purchase from you when they need your product/service.",2025-05-27 17:23:03,False
SocialMedia,young people and social media ban,This is how you can grow your presence on social media and finding variety in content to post,"The biggest challenge the business faces is figuring out what to post over social media. In most cases, I've seen them end up following what their competitors are doing or they agree to what the people are suggesting to them.

Following this approach will result in them capturing no unique position in the market, becoming yet another option for customers to choose from among thousands of the same brands.

**How to get variety in content idea:-** 

It’s easy to copy the world, but hard to make the world copy you. This is why thinking of a content theme requires a lot of search and effort. You need to identify-

1. Your brand vision, mission, and core message.
2. Analyze the strength of your product or service.
3. Define personality / archetype.
4. Identify your target audience so as to curate the content to easily resonate with them.

Once you get your analysis done, then it's time to benchmark your competitors using the same parameters. This will help you identify what they're doing and what additional elements you can incorporate to differentiate your brand in the eyes of your audience.

The goal through content posts is to make your brand visible as an authentic and credible brand for the respective product or service. To achieve this, it is always recommended to create 2-4 content themes, avoiding reliance on a single content type.

If one content theme makes people aware of how your product is produced, then another should tell a story of your brand and values, and why you do what you do. There might be an inclusion of some entertainment part as well with some funny humor. This will let people connect and engage with your brand both emotionally and in a funny way, also connect to a wider audience.

**How to grow the content over social media**

According to my experience, regular posting on specific platforms like Instagram or Facebook won't help you very much. This will lead to wasted efforts without achieving much. You must be thinking, what can be the solution? So, the key is to expand your reach by building a presence on different platforms and posting relevant content specific to each one. Also, I advise you to engage with the community and raise your voice to make yourself visible not with the intent of selling but with adding value to the conversation.

Your efforts and intention make you reach the place where you want to be. This will not come by simply following others or using just one content way.",4,7,Digitalmainstream,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/1dz4l27/this_is_how_you_can_grow_your_presence_on_social/,2024-07-09 15:00:59,"If this post [doesn't follow the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/about/rules/), please report it to the mods.

Parenting,Online Safety Amendment Act 2024,Just a father…,"TLDR: I ended a 9 year relationship because my partner was never present and had other priorities, now she’s being vindictive and manipulative leaving our son left in the middle of all her games and behaviour - all whilst I’m still being forced to fund her lavish lifestyle!

I’d like to start off by saying, this is my first post - I’ve been reluctant to post on here out of fear of backlash, adverse opinions but after reading so many other posts on the topic of the fathers side of child arrangement orders, it seems to be a recurring theme that fathers are almost always worse off after a relationship ends with a child involved (I'm not saying there aren't exceptions to this) and I’m just so confused!

I don’t know what I’m expecting as an outcome of posting this, ideally some sort of uprising I suppose, whereby the way that the court process for child arrangements actually provides a fairer outcome with the child’s best interests in mind - but albeit that seems a bit farfetched.

My main bug bear with my situation, is all these female “equal rights” advocates screaming about equality for things such as equal pay etc but when it comes to “parental rights”, I never hear advocates saying fathers should have an equal involvement in a child’s life.

Anyhow, to the point (key highlights/background):

+ Relationship started in 2014. We were in our early 20's.

+ Our son was born in December, 2015. 

+ Relationship was rocky throughout, common themes:

Spending all her time up the yard (horses)

Buying expensive sports cars (After agreeing we’d save for a house)

Claiming benefits (UC) when she shouldn’t have been. 

+ We went to counselling several times over the years for the above and other things. I attended counselling separately for some issues of my own (childhood trauma).

+ Relationship ended in 2023 for many reasons, I won’t go in to a massive amount of detail but she was never around, I looked after the kids (our son, and her daughter), I cooked and I cleaned the house. 

+ Following the breakup, she refused to speak to me or to allow me to have any contact with my son, simply claiming “he doesn’t want to” until I’d submitted a C100 to the courts for a child arrangements order after she refused to attend mediation whilst I continued paying her child support.

+ Fast forward to April, when the first hearing was due and she’d conveniently booked a holiday so couldn’t attend. A new hearing was then scheduled for June. 

+ In the June hearing, I’d expressed concerns relating to our sons safety and wellbeing as he’d been under the influence of marijuana and around people attempting to commit suicide whilst in her care, I didn’t say these things to make a point but because I was asked if I had any concerns, to which I’d answered honestly. An interim order was granted then and there allowing me to see my son again, on the basis of every Wednesday evening, and every other weekend, then half of all school holidays.

+ The next time I go to collect my son from school, he comes out acting very strange, almost refusing to make eye contact with me, then says “My mum told me to tell you I don’t want to see you today.”.  

+ Things continued like this for a while whilst the court hearing was ongoing. To confirm, she advised the courts that she had no concerns or reasons for me and my son to not spend time together or see each other, and to me it seems ridiculous that we’ve ended up in this situation after I decided to end a relationship on the basis that she spent no time around me or the kids. She just turned on the waterworks crying in the court room saying she just wants what’s best for him, as if I don’t?

+ During this period, my ex partner was also communicating with my mother, arranging for her to see our son. I was also ensuring that my mother was spending time with him. By the time of the final hearing it had equated to me and my mother spending 49% of his time with him, and him spending the other 51% of his time with his mother. 

+ During this period I continued to pay child maintenance, with the exception of January 2024 when I stated I was refusing to pay until she agreed to let me see our son or attend mediation to progress things (I don’t take pride in this, however we weren’t getting anywhere fast and the court were dragging their heels and it felt like the only leverage I had at the time on the situation). 

+ The final hearing occurred in October 2024, it seemed like a no brainer to me. I was asking for a 50/50 split, I’d purchased a house within a 20 minute drive of my ex partner and our son’s school. He’s never missed a day of school whilst in my care. I have a well paying job. We’re almost always out of the house doing fun activities, and my life is (and always has been) entirely focused around my son. He has always been extremely happy child and rarely complains.

+ Interim order stated that I would have my Son every Wednesday, as well as every other Weekend. I appreciate that this is more than some fathers get, but prior to the relationship ending this woman was never there so it felt like a real kick in the teeth, I was only asking for an additional night in the week.

+ My ex made out in the court hearing that I wasn’t facilitating any type of relationship between my mother and our son, and that it was all her doing. That she was having to let her (My mother) see him on her (My Ex's) time. Anyhow, the final outcome arrived and they dictated that things should “stay as they are”. It felt, and still feels very surreal.

+ The courtroom was full of magistrates who were all female, and I'm not saying that the verdict was solely based on them sympathising with the crying mother who's been dragged in to court to defend her rights to keep her son against her evil ex partner (me), but it definitely felt unfair that my ex partner had already been to court for the same reason with her daughter (refusing to let her ex see her also) so she understood the process and what to say.

+ We’ve had a number of issues since then, where I get told “he doesn’t want to see you” then I’ll arrive to a 9 year old child having a tantrum as if he’s been told I’m going to murder him if he comes with me. He's my little buddy, we've done everything together since he was born, we've built cars and travelled around the UK in them including the North Coast of Scotland (NC500, if you haven't done it already - then you need to!), gone fishing all over the solent, and do all the typical things you'd expect a father and son to do. We have an amazing relationship - but it's being tainted by the lies that his mother is still telling him to try and convince him that I'm the villain in this situation.

+ His sister (my ex partners daughter from a previous relationship) refuses to speak to me and states she hates me. Her father reached out, asking how I was and what had happened, as he was confused about why I’d suddenly abandoned his daughter. I explained that wasn’t the case and that I was actively trying to include her by inviting her out to dinner and for days out, but my Ex was filling her head with rubbish making out that I'd abandoned them all and didn't want anything to do with any of them.

+ Christmas 2024. The court order stated our son would wake up with one parent, then be collected by the other parent at 12PM on Christmas Day. I woke up with hope, but ended the day in tears. I dressed up as Santa to go and collect my son, I had all his presents ready under the tree, excited to spend the day with him. When I arrived, she (my ex partner) answered the door and scoffed at my outfit, and stated “he doesn’t want to come with you”, I asked to speak with him, and I could hear him screaming in the background. We spoke and I asked him calmly why he didn’t want to come, and he said “I just don’t want to”. I had flashbacks to when I was with my ex partner and would find her filling her daughters head with rubbish, saying things like ""You don't want to go to your Dads, because you'll miss me too much won't you?"".

+ Things don't appear to be getting much better, I've been sticking to the routine and my son has asked to stay with me longer on several occasions now, and when possible we'll call his mum up and ler her know he wants to stay - she's agreed to this twice since October '24.

+ We've booked to go away for this Easter holiday, to which she agreed to in January. After speaking this morning I fear that we're going to have a repeat of the Christmas incident due to her saying ""I'll see how he feels"" in response to me saying ""I'll pick him up on Monday"". Normally, someone would respond ""Sure"" or ""Not a problem"" opposed to pre-emptively thinking ""He won't want to come"". He's currently very excited and we've even arranged for him to bring a friend with us for the weekend, so it seems bizarre to imagine that he wouldn't want to go and spend a weekend away playing on the beach digging up fossils (Dorset).



Questions:

1) Why is the UK ""justice"" system still so backwards when it comes to child arrangement orders?

2) Why do mothers automatically get full access to a child, then fathers have to claw their way back in to a child's life slowly and painfully?

3) Why do child maintenance payments not count towards a mothers taxable income?
            My Ex is claiming benefits, has a new partner who earns an income, has a full time job herself and receives child maintenance from two fathers whilst driving around in her sports car worth £20k, has a horse lorry and three horses, All whilst I'm paying her 11% of my pre-tax salary, trying to pay for a mortgage so my son has a bedroom to live in and driving around in a 10 year old car.

4) Why was a verdict given, with no explanation? They simply stated that the verdict was ""things should stay as they are"", my presumption is that they came to this conclusion based on the following:
            A) My ex saying our son doesn't want to see me.
            B) Fear of my ex attempting to commit suicide again, after displaying her emotions in the court room.
            C) The lie my ex told, advising she was the only one facilitating a relationship with my paternal mother.



The entire situation has been immensely infuriating to be involved in, I'm a straightforward thinker and in my opinion the situation didn't pan out with my son's best interests in mind at all, he now spends majority of his time with his mother playing on his tablet, sat in his bedroom on his own, in the care of others (god forbid, I'd be allowed to have him any extra time) or up the yard whilst she tends to her horses. Her motives are solely based on ensuring that she continues to receive child maintenance payments.

I think the court system needs a serious review of the process, ideally whereby both parents are granted 50% care wherever possible by default, excluding abuse claims or where excessive travel would cause disruption to the child's schedule, and or lifestyle - but in this instance none of that was the case, in fact I'd argue the opposite that by granting his mother to have him more is having an adverse effect on his lifestyle and behaviour, as he now gets passed around more between her friends and family whilst she tends to her other ""priorities"". She now has full control over the situation and dictates where he goes, when and even who with telling me that I’m “just his father” implying I don’t have the same rights as she does whilst making decisions in his life, which feels to be strengthened by the outcome of the court case. 

This post is more of a rant / coping mechanism on the situation, and expressing my frustration about the fact that I spent several years being unhappy with my living situation in hopes things would improve before finally deciding to leave on the basis that I didn't think that the kids should have to grow up believing that what we (me and my ex) had was what a healthy relationship should look like, I knew things would never end amicably between us after witnessing the way she acted towards her ex partner - but I didn't expect her to act so manipulatively towards our son, who has noticeably been acting more withdrawn since the entire situation has unfolded.

Please don't interrupt the above as me implying that I'm Mr.Perfect, or that the relationship ended purely because of her actions, I spent several years attending counselling trying to work on myself, and now I'm trying not to dwell on the situation too much and just focus on the time I do still get to spend with my son, I already know that when he grows older he'll have a better understanding of manipulative behaviour - I just wonder at what cost?

I appreciate there was no outcome from the court case, where everyone would be happy. I equally appreciate that some time with my son is better than no time. In a world where everyone claims there are so many ""deadbeat"" Dads -  I'd like to think that everyone is as keen as I am to see a positive change in how the system works, yet it seems that the one's who are trying seem to get sh!t on the worst.

I can’t answer any of your questions. Know you’re not alone. I encourage you to appeal to courts decision, document everything, try seeing if there are social workers specialized in fathers work. 
I’m not sure about the laws of UK, where I live parental alienation is a form of child abuse so report as much as you can. Built up a case, have ideally witnesses like your mum, speak to the teachers. 
For eastern insist you speak to your son personally. I  would explain to him that his mum might tell him not to go because she’s jealous but he shouldn’t feel guilty to spend time with you. Make it clear this is mom’s doing.

AskParents,age verification social media Australia,"Hi, I 18F need tons of advice, any is appreciated","Hi, this is a long story, but I am so lost and really need some advice and compassion.  
My name is Sara, 18F. I was born in Syria (stayed there for seven years), lived in Egypt for two years, and then moved to Australia. Three years ago, I left school, and tried to do a diploma, but failed dramatically. I was also diagnosed with ADHD, OCD, PTSD, Anxiety, and Depression (mental cocktail!). The trauma includes sexual, social, educational and family trauma (I was sexually abused at five years old by a female cousin, and my parents constantly verbally abuse me). I also have tons of allergies and am way overweight (my body image sucks) It has been really tough on me especially since I am the oldest daughter. But currently is the worst. I have never had it worse...  
Firstly, I currently work at an Arabic school. Pretty much its a second school people go to, to improve their Arabic and Islamic skills. I used to be a student there and my mum teaches there. I don't have good social skills, which does give me some issues (I am a receptionist). I have never had issues with the parents, but I do face tons of issues with the teachers, and the manager. I always seem to be wrong no matter how hard I try. At my latest shift, my manager was there. She reminded me to check the classroom before I go, but I missed a table that was crooked, and forgot to put the small tables into a room. One of the rooms gets changed from a small table to a big tables room because of the students age difference. A teacher decided to help, and she put the tables away, so I let her help, which made my boss mad, since even though she helped I should have continued with her. The thing is, I genuinely didn't notice that it was rude, and don't get why she is mad.  She also got mad because I forgot to say goodbye when I left. She threatened to fire me, and even said that an untrained person would work better than me. She said that I have so much issues, and its bad enough that she was forced to give me a second chance (when I wasn't given shifts, I spoke with the principal and asked for feedback, and he told me that I am too much of a perfectionist, but I also miss things and they have issues with the fact that I wear heals. I told him that I will work on my issues and he made me repeat training before giving me a shift). I sat crying for hours after because I genuinely don't understand how to be better, but I did send my manager the message below:   
((( Salam Alykum Ms Name,  
I hope you are well,  
I sincerely apologize for all my mistakes, I understand that there is no excuse, and I will do better.  
Thank you so much for the second chance, it really means so much to me.  
I understand that sometimes I may come off and disrespectful but I don't mean to. I will work on my communication skills, and will ask for more feedback.  
I will also make sure that all my tasks are completed as you have taught me (even if it means staying back or coming in a little early), I have made checklists for every tasks.  
I will also take my time with accounting tasks and double check all numbers to prevent future errors.  
Could you please send me a list of any other mistakes I have missed, or any other things I could do to improve. What do you think is appropriate for me to be a better employee?  
Jazak Allah Khair )))  
Secondly, my psychologist quit yesterday. I can't afford to pay for one, and he uses the bulk bill service (so the government pays), and its tough to find a new one that uses the bulk bill feature. I really have a hard time dealing with day-to-day issues, communication, and my adhd and ocd struggles. I also am struggling with tons of nightmares and insomnia; how can I manage all of that without someone professional to guide me?  
Thirdly, I recently rejected a proposal because I am not ready to be married. But my mum gave me a ""reality check"" saying that these people aren't asking for me for me, but because i have amazing parents. She said that if a man was to actually meet me, he wouldn't want me for me...  
Fourthly, I am currently helping me dad with his companies. He always yells at me for silly things like e.g., dad gave me a bank statement to fix, and he told me not to change his work, so I didn't. Then he got mad that I didn't notice that he didn't number the transactions and he had to redo it! He told me not to change a thing. Also, if a task takes longer because I am learning how to do it from scratch, he thinks that he shouldn't pay me for those hours (its literally $8 per hr.), because it isn't his fault. He says a lot of people would kiss his foot and pay him to train them (he is very narcissistic and hates spending money).   
Fifthly, my mum works and cleans and cooks, so she is exhausted. Especially since both my brothers never clean up after themselves, and even if they help, its bad and we have to redo it. She kept getting people to intervene with me since I am not helping enough, and the recent intervention ended with me cooking five times a day, and deep cleaning five things per week. I also have to fold all laundry and pack away the dishwasher. This takes around 3 hours of my day, and I am getting exhausted.  
Sixth of all, I don't know how to drive. I really get scared when driving and always feel like I am going to crash (intrusive thoughts and OCD). I am currently driving around with mum, but she is pushing me to hard and it is scary.  
Seventh of all, I am struggling with my studies, this is the fifth time I retry my degree, I have nine units left and two months. I really struggle with focusing and have no clue what to do.  
Eighth of all, I am having weight loss issues. Every time I try to lose weight through working out, or diet, I end up gaining more weight. I used to only be 15 kg overweight, but now I am 50 kg overweight. I currently have a gym membership, and it is fun, has tons of classes, but it is one hr away by public transport.  
Ninth of all, my parents always fight. I always get scared of their fights and cry in my room, or I try and break up their fight. They both use me as their personal therapist, and trauma dump on me. It is exhausting...  
Finally, I am struggling with my mental health. I can't handle the stress of everything I go through, and genuinely don't know what to do, any advice and tips are appreciated.

SocialMedia,Australia under 16 social media ban,"I think I need advice, please?","Hellodeo!

I run a very small business, and I'm struggling with social media growth. My primary setback seems to be a constant bombardment of spam.

Every. Single. Social media account. I'm either getting shadow-banned or spammed.  
I can't get out from under the spam to get any sort of push towards genuine engagement and growth, and I'd wager that the nothing-but-spam engagement is negatively impacting my accounts.  
Here are my current issues with each platform-  
**Instagram** - Every post I make either gets zero interaction, or I get 2-3 spam comments and spam DMs. Insights show I'm averaging a reach of 5 people, and almost none of that reach is 'non-followers'.  
**TikTok** - Every video caps out in the 200-views range, or gets nothing at all. Even a post with a 25%+ like rate stopped at 200 views. I occasionally also get tagged by spam.  
**Twitter** - I've honestly given up on this one. I recently commented on a friend's post and a bot responded to me. Friend was like, ""why are the bots following you like this?!""  
**Facebook** - This one's a real doozy. Even my *personal page* is apparently shadow-banned so that my friends haven't seen any of my posts in weeks. But my business page? I'm in the process of requesting a refund for the $5 I put into FB Meta Ads, because ALL of the engagement they charged me for was spam. ALL of it. I've spent the last 2 days reporting, blocking, and deleting spam in my comments, DMs, and email, all from this one boosted post that I paid for, and got zero real engagement for my efforts. I had to stop the ad because of this, and I'm STILL getting spammed.  
**YouTube/Patreon** - I'm still really new to these and don't actually know what I'm doing lol. But if nothing else is working, I have pretty low expectations on these.

I don't \*think\* I'm doing anything wrong. I think I'm appropriately 'niched down'? I'm using a mixture of relevant hashtags, and I've tried using lots of tags and tried doing just a few. I'm so sad. I work so hard, and I'm always so excited to share what I'm working on, but it feels like I'm just sharing it with the void. I can't even get entries to my giveaway (most of which are social media related entries), because the posts I make about it aren't being shown to anyone.

I do understand that genuine growth is slow, but I'm not getting \*any\* growth at all even with ads, and I don't know what to do or how to stop getting spammed into oblivion.

**Edit:** I forgot about **Pinterest.** I've been told my stuff is very 'Pinterest-worthy', but despite my best efforts I still do not understand how to use Pinterest at all.",4,20,EatMeBoutique,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/1d60i2n/i_think_i_need_advice_please/,2024-06-02 00:01:21,"If this post [doesn't follow the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/about/rules/), please report it to the mods.

Don't ever pay for advertising for one that's nothing more than a scam

Maybe you aren’t making content that is engaging or reaching the right audience. If you start posting quality content, analyze the trends you WILL get the engagement you want.

If you have tried doing it on your own and it’s not working then i would suggest you to invest a little and hire a marketing team to do that.

A lot of people I talk to ask me about this. The problem is always the content. If you make content that your target audience finds valuable (whether that's through education or entertainment), your videos will get views. Making content is a skill and takes practice. A lot of people with businesses struggle on social media because they're just trying to promote their products on there and they basically just post ads. You have to make content people actually want to watch. If you're self promoting in every video, people aren't going to care. But that's why making videos that your target audience would like is super helpful. Eventually, you'll have a giant group of your ideal customers sitting there all in one place. And even better, it's people that like YOU and your videos. So, once you DO want to promote your stuff, it'll sell like crazy. Build up the good will through valuable content and then make your pitch later.

Hi there,  ohh, I can relate with you every single line by line.
I've ""been there done that"" reads my T Shirt,  if I got one.

I agree that all those social media accounts are pretty much dead. Instagram is one of the worst.. with spamming, just disgusting. YES, FB is a snoozer.

I wonder how FB still has anyone still spending $1.
I did research on what will even make a dent with people's 
Attention. That is what you need for people to stop ✋️ and look if it speaks interest. 

People look for FREE information , entertainment, etc., quick fixes, etc.

Even if one is able to cook up a course about something, most of it is selling a lot of hot air.
BUT that's something I still believe might have a chance. 
Selling information is still if packed ✅️ right a possibility. 

Have you thought about any of this? Like I said, I don't know what you're offering , but perhaps you also look what you're competion is doing and just copy that.

Of course, the obvious descriptions and hashtags, etc.

Wish you luck!

SocialMedia,Australia under 16 social media ban,From 500 Followers to Thousands: A Psychologist’s Journey on Instagram,"Hi everyone! I’m reaching out to ask for your advice on growing my Instagram following. I’m a psychologist, PhD student, and university lecturer, and I currently have 515 followers. My profile focuses on psychology, stress management, crisis intervention, coaching, and nonviolent communication (NVC). My goal is to build a larger, engaged audience (thousands of followers) and establish myself as a unique voice in my field—especially since there aren’t many male psychologists or educators in my region using social media this way.

Here’s some context to better explain where I’m coming from and what I’m working with:

Current Profile Stats (Last 90 Days):
	•	Accounts Reached: 7,947 (94.7% non-followers).
	•	Engaged Accounts: 264 (40.2% non-followers).
	•	Followers: 515 (+9.1%, about 43 new followers).
	•	My Reels reach: Between 50–70% non-followers.

Content Highlights:
	•	My best-performing Reels cover topics like PTSD & Tetris (based on a study), disaster psychology (linked to recent floods in my country), and Spotify Wrapped-inspired psychology tips.
	•	Engagement on Reels includes 297 likes, 18 comments, 16 saves, and 15 shares over the last 90 days.
	•	I’ve also shared snippets from a podcast I was invited to and an article I contributed to for a local newspaper. Even though I only promoted these through Stories, they received surprisingly positive feedback and engagement.

Courses and Future Plans:
	•	I already run Nonviolent Communication (NVC) courses that consistently fill up without relying on Instagram. These focus on practical skills like improving communication and understanding others.
	•	As a university lecturer, I’ve created lessons that are highly self-developmental and resonate well with young people. I believe I could transition some of these into the commercial space in the future.
	•	I’m also considering starting a YouTube channel. I think the longer format would suit me better for delivering more in-depth content. However, I currently lack the editing and production skills to make this a reality, so I’m focusing on Instagram to refine my content creation abilities.

Challenges:

One of my biggest struggles is structuring a marketing plan for social media. While I’ve done some research, I find it challenging to create a clear, consistent strategy. I’d love any advice, templates, or tools that could help me approach this more effectively.

I’ve looked into marketing consultations, but they’re currently beyond my financial reach. I understand these are valuable and often expensive services, but since this is more of a passion project than a business venture right now, I’m hoping to find alternative guidance.

Here’s Where I’d Love Your Help:
	1.	How can I optimize my content strategy to convert reach and engagement into followers?
	2.	Are there specific tactics or strategies that have worked for educators or psychologists trying to stand out on Instagram?
	3.	Do you have any advice or resources for creating a structured marketing plan for Instagram? (Templates, tools, or personal tips.)
	4.	How can I position myself as a unique voice in my region while focusing on self-development topics for young people?
	5.	What are your thoughts on paid ads—are they worth it for a profile like mine?
	6.	Are there other creative ways to grow as an account and attract more followers?

Lastly, I’d really appreciate it even if you just shared some thoughtful questions that I should reflect on to better clarify my strategy or next steps. If you have additional questions to help you provide advice, please feel free to ask—I’ll respond quickly!

Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this and for any insights you’re willing to share. I’m incredibly grateful for your help!",4,3,FluidStatistician794,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/1hykozk/from_500_followers_to_thousands_a_psychologists/,2025-01-11 01:29:27,"If this post [doesn't follow the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/about/rules/), please report it to the mods.

Hey! It’s great that you’re building a platform focused on such valuable topics. It sounds like you’re already seeing positive engagement, which is a solid foundation.

To grow your Instagram, I’d suggest optimizing content that aligns with both your niche and your audience’s interests. Focus on creating content that’s digestible, like bite-sized tips, interactive Q&A sessions, or myth-busting posts. Since your content already gets engagement through Reels, keep riding that wave—try sharing more relatable, engaging content based on trending topics in psychology or stress management. For instance, share “quick tips” on stress relief or a small series on nonviolent communication.

It’s also important to be consistent. Setting a content calendar helps you stay on track and diversify your posts. Perhaps alternate between educational posts and personal insights (e.g., a quick personal story about your experience with stress management). Since your audience is young and you're into education, you might also try to engage them more with polls, quizzes, and debates on psychological topics through Instagram Stories.

As for structuring your marketing plan, using simple tools like Google Sheets, Notion, or Trello can help you stay organized. You can create templates around your core themes—this gives you flexibility while maintaining consistency. Maybe even set small goals every month—like reaching X number of followers or creating content around a trending psychological topic.

Paid ads are definitely worth exploring once you have a content rhythm, but they shouldn’t be your first step. Instead, focus on organic growth—if you see consistent engagement, you can then boost posts to further your reach. Lastly, I think your unique angle of male psychology educators is a great niche. Keep highlighting that—perhaps with hashtags or in captions so people know that your perspective is rare and valuable in your region.

Keep it authentic, and keep at it—you’ll get there! Also I have previously helped a lot of life coaches and pyschologist. Would love to give you a free 1:1 call, dm for info.",2025-01-11 01:29:27,False

AskParents,kids off social media,Opinion on privacy in extracurriculars?,"My child is in an extracurricular ball league. When I played, parents weren't allowed on the field or in the dugout unless they were coaches/helpers. Back then we didn't have social media, and no one was carrying a camera around in their pocket at all times. 

My child's team is a different world! There was no policy laid out by the league when we joined, but now there are parents sitting in the dugout taking photos and videos whether their child is with the whole group or standing as an individual. They aren't just taking photos during the game, but also videos. At the end of the game the coach huddles the kids up and congratulates them on playing well, points out players who did great, etc. Parents are stepping into the ballfield to video record this huddle!

I know their are people who are all over social media, that want to share their lives with the world. But the coach has asked us to not take photos or videos during full-group huddles or when other kids' faces are up close and their names are also being called. The parents aren't listening.

Upon asking the president of the league for backup, we are being told that ""your child is playing in public and anyone from anywhere can walk up and take photos from them without being asked."" So basically, forget your kid's privacy and allow us to keep publicly sharing your child's face on our public social media page because we don't care about your privacy or their's.

What do I do with this? No one will back me up but we are halfway done the season so it's too late to play for another league. The coach has already spoken his mind about it but no one is listening. As an assistant, they clearly won't listen to me either. I would hate to ruin this and pull my kid, but do I just roll over and pretend this is okay with me and every other parent? 

Note: these are super young kids if that makes a difference.

The parents knew what they signed up for when they enrolled their kid. It's not hard to go online and find a school yearbook with the exact same information.

Unfortunately they are right. It's a public space, anyone can see what's going on and post videos.

For this situation, I don't feel it's a big invasion of privacy. A handful of videos or photos that might have your kid in the on the side, playing ball, isn't a huge issue, imo. 

It's when people post their kids entire lives online. Document everything, with first last names, ages, locations.

Looking back, a few photos of kid playing ball won't be embarrassing or problematic.
---
My daughter isn't in a sport so I don't have experience with that. But, they're right about being in public. You can't force them to stop. But, you can take steps to minimize risk. When I take my daughter in public, I stay right beside her, if possible. If someone takes a picture our direction, I put my hand in front of her face. I've also taught her to say, ""Please don't take my picture"" or turn her body or face so it's not in the picture. If she's asked someone not to take her picture and they do anyway, I would call them out  (that hasn't happened yet, thankfully) because respecting someone's privacy when they ask is common decency.  It may seem excessive but if people went through what I did, I'm sure they would be just as protective. Especially with all of the new AI things happening with child p*rn.

I also have kids in little league and I take professional level photos (from the stands but zoomed in on individual kids). I share the photos with the parents of those particular children and don’t post any online. If a parent asked me not to photo their kid or not to post I would bend over backwards to let them know I won’t and to immediately stop photographing their kid, and ensure their kid isn’t in the background of other pics.",2025-05-10 19:30:49,False

My hammer doesn’t send me push notifications to get me to come interact with it. Apps try and hijack your dopamine response to condition you to increase usage to extract more data and trends. I find that to be wrong. I would not have a problem with an app selling my data if I got a cut of the revenue generated and it was an opt-in choice. We need more fine grain control over who can access what and when.
---
What bothers me is that it’s used to manipulate us into spending, believing, doing, or whatever. And is capable of learning us more more intimately than any human relationship. And, if you were a relationship with someone you knew was a manipulator, you would probably cut ties or limit interaction. But most people don’t realize they’re in that relationship with seemingly harmless online interactions.

AustralianPolitics,young people and social media ban,"House prices: NIMBYism, construction costs, red tape are why you can’t afford to buy a home","The enabling of new planned cities and exurbs with greater density and outstanding amenities may be the best of the worst alternatives.













My [first appearance in the Coalition party room as planning minister](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/no-time-lost-as-goward-dumps-haddad-20140424-i4b7h) began as a pleasant surprise. I was rushed by colleagues who had treated me as family and community services minister with distant, pitying looks.

That day, every backbencher smiled.

There are many reasons why housing has become unaffordable, but the number of councils does not help. Peter Rae

As it turned out, apart from the member for Parramatta, who always wanted more infrastructure, most members wanted me to stop something.

A high-rise apartment block near a railway station – no, thank you, parking problems. An old tennis court converted to apartments – no, thank you, we love tennis. A tunnel bypass with chimney stacks to get trucks off Pennant Hills Road – no way, chimney stacks cause cancer.

They never stopped, members dutifully representing their communities, aided and abetted by radio shock jocks who saw opposition to development as ranting-ratings opportunities.

Urban planning, and land use more generally, are the Australian states’ constitutional responsibility. Local councils have gradually ceded authority to state planning rules while retaining sufficient power to attract angry public meetings and the ever-present opportunities for corruption. Inner suburban councils flatly refuse to meet their housing targets.

Australian governance is hallmarked by overreach – one bad media story and sweeping legislative reforms are rushed through the parliament, and planning law sets the pace. Every new government finds new ways of stopping housing, disguising this as new environmental, health or other community regulations paid for by those greedy developers and eventually by home buyers.

>

The number of councils aids this reluctance. Take the long-discussed Parramatta Road redevelopment in Sydney. In 2014, 13 councils needed to agree on how to reactivate and densify this mere 23 kilometres linking the villages of Sydney to Australia’s fastest-growing city.

Unsurprisingly, they are still only talking about it 11 years later. Had I my time over again, knowing these were ALP or Green seats we could not hope to win, I would have ignored participatory democracy and overruled them.

Note to our premiers: if you do not need the seat, do what you like. The people of Unley Park, the northern beaches or Toorak are never going to vote for you anyway.

The point is that there are few tools for a federal government to increase the supply of housing or lower its costs. Even interest rates are an uncertain path to lower costs. Reducing housing loan deposit requirements will increase demand but not supply. Offering the states and territories more money to get out of the way has not worked – regulatory costs are still estimated to constitute 50 per cent of total building expenses. National schemes inevitably fail.

Gough Whitlam established the Department of Urban and Regional Development, DURD, in 1972. It invested heavily in revitalising the inner-city slums for low-income workers, immediately exploited by their richer, smarter cousins, but did nothing for density. DURD also costs a fortune. Every project it touched doubled in price as the much shrewder state housing authorities saw them coming.

[The minister’s recent pledge to cut red tape will fall on the deaf ears of the states](https://www.afr.com/politics/o-neil-declares-war-on-red-tape-to-fix-housing-crisis-20250606-p5m5gs) so long as they bear the political pain of densification. Using Commonwealth powers to reduce immigration, as former NSW premier Bob Carr urged in a rare moment of courage, would make a difference to housing demand and lessen the unrelenting need for more roads. Neatly avoided by the minister, Andrew Bragg and Andrew Leigh.

Besides, reducing immigration does not affect the current crisis, merely future ones. Now that working from home is embedded, regional centres are a cheaper option for young families, but improved regional public transport is urgently required.

Australia’s housing problem comes down to construction costs and opposition to density. This opposition, the much-discussed NIMBYism, limits potential supply and encourages over-regulation. It is based on the realistic appreciation that density does not bring better local infrastructure and transport automatically, and, when it does, is preceded by years of severe disruption.

The further away the planning approval authority politically, the easier it is for elected officials to bear the pain. Bigger councils and regional authorities all help.

This is precisely what modern democracies do not want: a diminution of an individual’s authority to protect their own interests (with the national interest now a distant echo of its former self). Woe betides the first government to legislate this authority away. In fact, opposition to development would reduce if governments committed to underwriting improved construction times, expanded public transport and reduced disruption with industrial, environmental and productivity policies.

The extraordinary growth in created cities and high-density vertical suburbs in the US since the war has been one response to the housing and democracy conflict.

Australia’s current housing crisis is a profound challenge to the stability and harmony provided by high levels of homeownership. It is not as simple as spending more money. It requires attention to the more difficult problem of spending less.

If it is too late to change well-entrenched inner-city communities – and it is not – then our timid governments could make boldness their friend. The enabling of new planned cities and exurbs with greater density and outstanding amenities may be the best of the worst alternatives.

This crisis will not end well otherwise.",4,75,Leland-Gaunt-,https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/nimbyism-and-construction-costs-are-why-you-can-t-own-a-home-20250606-p5m5kt,2025-06-10 01:09:53,"**Greetings humans.**

Kind of a crappy article, but not wrong.

Our current situation gives too many rights to existing residents and councils and too few to future residents. The benefits of more housing are diffuse, lower prices for everyone, while the ""drawbacks"" are concentrated - a few homeowners live next to a higher density block.

I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this. What was that? Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Come on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Can I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Come on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?"" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Can I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out your job and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Cinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet. What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Cute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Crazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Carl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose blood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours. - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee! - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit. What is this place? A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. - Check out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey, and we make the money. ""They make the honey, and we make the money""? Oh, my! What's going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn't last too long. Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! Bee honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to humans. - What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! Make out? Barry! We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you want to do with your life? I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees! Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop. I remember that. What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one bee do? Sting them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! - That would hurt. - No. Up the nose? That's a killer. There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source. No more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Chung. - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Chung. A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally! Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, Classy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this""? Bees have never been afraid to change the world. What about Bee Columbus? Bee Gandhi? Bee Jesus? Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. How old are you? The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century. You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too. It's a common name. Next week... He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em. Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81. Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race. - Hello. - Hello, bee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working. But it's our yogurt night! Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours! Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help. - Frosting... - How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the competition. So why are you helping me? Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now. Those are great, if you're three. And artificial flowers. - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too. Bent stingers, pointless pollination. Bees must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. Maybe this could make up for it a little bit. - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess. You sure you want to go through with it? Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty! It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here, Barry? It's pretty big, isn't it? I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day. You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade. - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill. Well, if it isn't the bee team. You boys work on this? All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Case number 4475, Superior Court of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively? A privilege. Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world? I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids! Mr. Benson? Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice! Call your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have. I suppose so. I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron! Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms. Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term. I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you? - No. - I couldn't hear you. - No. - No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey. They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. You mean like this? Bears kill bees! How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police. But you've never been a police officer, have you? No, I haven't. No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! That's not his real name?! You idiots! Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow. I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir? Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now! This isn't a goodfella. This is a bad fella! Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?! - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side. Are we doing everything right, legally? I'm a florist. Right. Well, here's to a great team. To a great team! Well, hello. - Ken! - Hello. I didn't think you were coming. No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery. I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. There's a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby. That's where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill. You think I don't see what you're doing? I know how hard it is to find the right job. We have that in common. Do we? Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out. That's just what I was thinking about doing. Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right. I'm going to drain the old stinger. Yeah, you do that. Look at that. You know, I've just about had it with your little mind games. - What's that? - Italian Vogue. Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages. A lot of ads. Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine? Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here! I love the smell of flowers. How do you like the smell of flames?! Not as much. Water bug! Not taking sides! Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat! This is pathetic! I've got issues! Well, well, well, a royal flush! - You're bluffing. - Am I? Surf's up, dude! Poo water! That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings! Kenneth! What are you doing?! You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it! We need to talk! He's just a little bee! And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time! Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life? No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them! Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night... My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster! Goodbye, Ken. And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man! I'm sorry about all that. I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it! I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well. Are you OK for the trial? I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas. We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers... Yeah. Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over. Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees. - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic? Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? We're friends. - Good friends? - Yes. How good? Do you live together? Wait a minute... Are you her little... ...bedbug? I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children? - Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents! - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are! Hold me back! You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson? He's denouncing bees! Don't y'all date your cousins? - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy! Adam, don't! It's what he wants! Oh, I'm hit! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way! - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs. What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. - Is there much pain? - Yeah. I... I blew the whole case, didn't I? It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died. I'd be better off dead. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it. What was it like to sting someone? I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy! All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world. What will the humans do to us if they win? I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad. Adam, they check in, but they don't check out! Oh, my. Could you get a nurse to close that window? - Why? - The smoke. Bees don't smoke. Right. Bees don't smoke. Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking. That's it! That's our case! It is? It's not over? Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere. Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub. Mr. Flayman. Yes? Yes, Your Honor! Where is the rest of your team? Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time. I actually heard a funny story about... Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion. But you can't! We have a terrific case. Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? It's a bee smoker! What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee. Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, ""Smoking or non?"" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card. Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! The court finds in favor of the bees! Vanessa, we won! I knew you could do it! High-five! Sorry. I'm OK! You know what this means? All the honey will finally belong to the bees. Now we won't have to work so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson. You'll regret this. Barry, how much honey is out there? All right. One at a time. Barry, who are you wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean? We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years. Congratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement? First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine. We're all aware of what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take him out. He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine. And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames... But it's just a prance-about stage name! ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments. Can't breathe. Bring it in, boys! Hold it right there! Good. Tap it. Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming! - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down. Shut down honey production! Stop making honey! Turn your key, sir! What do we do now? Cannonball! We're shutting honey production! Mission abort. Aborting pollination and nectar detail.

teenagers,let kids be kids campaign,"How to make your college (and other) spike stand out, from my (brief) experience. PT. 1 Extracurriculars ","This point is mentioned a lot, but many kids applying to college, or any prestigious award, scholarship, grant, summer program, fly-in, etc, lack a *cohesive* story. Everyone talks about spikes, but rarely can kids make a compelling, relevant, and harmonious spike. And that’s ok. 

Now, I am only a senior who has just finished applying, and getting into a T5 school (yes HYPSM), but I have read the applications of dozens of my peers locally, nationally, and internationally. All have sound “stats and ECS”. What they lack is a *real* spike.

I was able to get into a top school with no significant national or international awards/commitments. No Olympiads, no Science Fairs, no humanities awards. No published research, no 6 figure NGO, no successful startup etc. 

Granted, I did make lackluster efforts at each and everyone of the things I mentioned, and they definitely added to my application. 

What’s bigger was my story. I’m not talking about just ECS, though that is what I will start with. 

**These descriptions are often undercooked**

* You need to dig deep and find the little things involved with your activities and how you can portray them for your spike
   * ex) Chemistry TA can become:
      * “Gained experience working in a lab by preparing molal solutions for 50+ students, and using equipment like volumetric flasks and burettes” 
      * “Prepared labs directions, and helped 5 groups of students at a time complete the lab while adjusting for minor accident” 
   * One description lends more to STEM and working in a lab, while the other lends more to HEAL and being a leader/educator. One experience can go in dozens of directions depending on the spike. 

* **Work**
   * Often it's easiest to grab soft skills from otherwise menial work
   * Unless the duties of the job fit your interests and intended spike, “managed time and X tasks in a busy kitchen setting” always beats “washed dishes in the Olive Garden kitchen” 
   * Again, different soft skills can convey different things for your spike
* **School Activities**
   * Rising to leaderships positions in these clubs is a must, but also connect your duties, and journey to your future goals
   * It’s one thing to be a leader, but it's another to explain the journey and how the journey related to the future
      * Maybe you became a better public speaker by presenting election speeches, getting you over your fear of audiences
      * Or maybe you learned organizational skills while you were planning and running your campaign
   * These are two completely different skills that can sway how you and your story are perceived.  

* **Volunteering**
   * This is where quantifying is the most important, how many people did you help? How long did you help them on a daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, lifetime span? How many things did you help package? Volunteering descriptions *need* to have a lot of numbers.
   * Beyond that, you can choose to focus on how you helped. 
      * Did you teach kids 1 on 1, lending to an educator trope? 
      * Maybe you did more computer work and made organizations more efficient lending to a data science trope? 
      * Maybe you made google forms, posters, or webpages lending to a marketing trope? 
   * The truth is you could have very well done all three, but choosing what to focus on, and why you focus on it is the difference between a strong spike and a weak one

Did I miss anything? Any particular types of ECS you want me to cover? Let me know your thoughts on this. I want to also cover: honors/awards, essays, recommendation letters, dual-enrollments/AP/honor classes, additional info, background, and personality among others as they come up.

privacy,kids off social media,"Parents, How Do You Keep Your Family’s Data Safe Online?","Hey parents! I’m Graham, and I’m doing some research about how families manage online privacy. With so much of our lives happening online, I’m curious about a few things:

1. Are you more concerned about your kids' online privacy (social media, apps, schooling), your own, or both?
2. Do you use any tools to manage your family’s data privacy? If not, what’s stopping you?
3. What kinds of data (location, financial, browsing history, etc.) are you most worried about protecting?
4. If there was a tool that summarized privacy policies and helped you opt out of data sharing, would you use it?
5. How skeptical are you about big tech companies and the way they handle your family’s data?

Your input would be super valuable for my research, and I’m really interested in hearing how other parents are handling these challenges. Thanks for your help!

This is a fun topic of conversation, and I am honored to discuss it with you, especially as most parents don't even consider anything close to this... handing devices to their young children with completely unrestricted access to the internet. 

1) I'm more concerned with MY privacy, and concerned about teaching my children HOW to manage their privacy. My intervention will not be helpful once they are on their own. Note that your child's age is important to consider. The game changes completely if my child is 10 years old versus 16+. As a general point, other people are out of our control, and you can only do so much. 

2) Signal group chat. Use a service to wipe data broker records. 

3) Safety is always first. Nothing bad has ever happened (\*knock on wood\*) that was honestly any ""threat"" to our family privacy, but I fear if my daughter ever gets stalked by a dangerous man. That would be terrifying. The only ""location"" service that makes me feel ""decently"" respected is Apple's Find My family location sharing. My parents use Life360 and I refused to opt-in, which caused mild offense to my mother. Then again, I have location services disabled on my phone 99% of the time unless I am using GPS to a location I've never been to/unfamiliar. 

4) Yep. I love the [TOSDR](https://tosdr.org/) browser extension as one example. 

5) Fairly skeptical, but considering millions of people use these services, I am not going to act in a dramatic fashion thinking anyone is going to be harmed over using them. Proton Family is awesome, but pricey. 

I highly encourage you to read the 3-page article (page 14-16) out of UNREDACTED Magazine titled, ""SUCCESSES AND FAILURES OF A PRIVACY ENTHUSIAST IN A NON-ENTHUSIASTIC FAMILY."" The author is mostly unsuccessful, but has a few ""wins"" along the way that might help frame your understanding of this concept.

Any tips on finding local parenting groups or places to meet people during the holidays? How did you keep your toddler entertained and manage social connections during this time of year?

Check with your local library as they may have storytelling and information about what else is available in your area

Say yes to anything.  Tell everyone you meet that you are new to the area and are looking to make contacts and never say no.

Give everything you go to at least two tries before you write it off.  One activity that you don’t like may have contacts that lead to another.

Your local council should be able to advise you on mothers groups or local play groups.  Some churches run the MOPS program - Mothers of Pre-Schoolers.  I think there is some sort of bible study or religious discussion that goes on with that though, so if you’re not religious, maybe not.

During school holidays, a lot of libraries put on little shows and activities for young children.  Just look up your library’s website or ask in person.

My kids always loved Mini Maestros too, it’s a music and movement class.  Give them a google to see if there’s a class in your area.  I made some great friends through that.

Just watched last night's 730 interview regarding Duttons purchasing bank shares with possible insider knowledge. The ABC host puts just as much effort into questioning Labor's benefit from the news as she did on the potential corruption.

privacy,Online Safety Amendment Act 2024,KOSA - ,"Take action: https://act.eff.org/action/tell-congress-kosa-will-censor-the-internet-but-won-t-help-kids

Language pulled for EFF

“KOSA is still a censorship bill and it will still harm a large number of minors who have First Amendment rights to access lawful speech online. It will endanger young people and impede the rights of everyone who uses the platforms, services, and websites affected by the bill. Based on our previous analyses, statements by its authors and various interest groups, as well as the overall politicization of youth education and online activity, we believe the following groups—to name just a few—will be endangered:  

LGBTQ+ Youth will be at risk of having content, educational material, and their own online identities erased.
  
Young people searching for sexual health and reproductive rights information will find their search results stymied.
 
Teens and children in historically oppressed and marginalized groups will be unable to locate information about their history and shared experiences. 

Activist youth on either side of the aisle, such as those fighting for changes to climate laws, gun laws, or religious rights, will be siloed, and unable to advocate and connect on platforms. 
 
Young people seeking mental health help and information will be blocked from finding it, because even discussions of suicide, depression, anxiety, and eating disorders will be hidden from them. 

Teens hoping to combat the problem of addiction—either their own, or that of their friends, families, and neighbors, will not have the resources they need to do so.  

Any young person seeking truthful news or information that could be considered depressing will find it harder to educate themselves and engage in current events and honest discussion. 

Adults in any of these groups who are unwilling to share their identities will find themselves shunted onto a second-class internet alongside the young people who have been denied access to this information”. 

And as for age verification- that means companies and services designed to scan ID and verify age will have even more data about us.

Parenting,young people and social media ban,Mine and my daughters relationship,"Hi all. 
Just some context my ex and I split when my daughter was very young 4yo. It was the best separation as my ex cheated but I tried to do what I should to make it easy for my daughter my ex and i shared 50/50 custody. My daughter and I had a great relationship amazing almost but there was a period at 10yo where she didn't come back for a month cause I told her off to which i then found out it was because her mum was taking her to go on dates with a boy alone (I think my daughter should be a child and enjoy that) and it ended up with the boy a year older breaking her heart. 
She then came back and things were back to normal.
Additional context her mother hates how close we are or were as of a few months ago and had tried manipulating my daughter and people around I was a horrible person and never actually had my daughter and just dropped her to my mums which was only during work hours she was at my mums and then she started school. She git busted by doing this to people and 2 knew me and how much I love and do with my daughter and called her out. 
Now my daughter and her mother's relationship was not the best I tried to encourage it so much and help my ex too as my daughter would come crying to me how bad her mother was from a young age and how she got shoved to the side for her mother's relationship and then when her mother had a child with her partner even more so.
I would try let my ex know without trying to be I don't know I guess like I was telling her what to do.
Well it came to a head 9 months ago my daughter refused to go to her mums to which her mum even said she needs a break. That was fine and my daughter changed mentally was so much happier. I was encouraging her to see her mum and try going back to which she did eventually.
Well my daughter git caught in a lie where she had a vape and blamed it on other people which I found out later it was her. We talked and I said look always tell me the truth it's better than lying and supported her through that and she understood that she was grounded and such.
November last year I found she had a tiktok account which she wasn't allowed on her mother's and I agreement with 8k followers and over a million views of her dancing like an adult (she is 13 now). 
There was creepy old men on there and inappropriate comments. 
She was at her mums so I called her mother and we spoke she said she wasn't happy and was talking with her and that she was going to be coming to mime following day as per usual and she would not be able to avoid consequences (grounding phone ban and such). My ex and I had an agreement also we wouldn't allow her to do this.
Well next morning I get a message she isn't coming back that my ex is now allowing her on all social media and basically she has no rules. I only saw my daughter on Christmas to get her presents and go and she was using my card a lot as I gave it to her for emergencies when at her mums or school she spent over 800 in 2 weeks and has now been cut from card access.
Her mother seemed to enjoy this and my daughter seemed to change. The last day I had her she made a comment to me of how I'm an ugly shrek looking freak and nobody would want me when it git brought up about a girlfriend (I don't  have one) so she just changed i guess.
She recently went to my sisters as my ex started putting in rules and then I was told she didn't want to come back to mine at all but wanted to return to her mother eventually. I have seen my daughter a fair bit since at my sisters as she has come for stuff I have taken her to for sport and she would vent hard about her mother I'd just listen.
Now she is returning to her mother's but still it seems I'm only talked to when money is involved.
What have I done wrong? I mean I'm not perfect i have rules yes I have chores yes and while I never hit or yell at her I still raise my voice and will call out things.

His friend across the street came, and no one else. It was our first year in a new town/new school (but he is a spring birthday so he'd been here a full year). Since we didn't get any RSVPs we weren't sure if anyone would show, but we talked with him in the week leading up about ""people may be busy, it's baseball season, if they don't come we will still have a great time."" We set-up for the party, waited at the house for about an hour in case anyone showed, and then took him and his one friend who showed up to an arcade for the afternoon (a surprise). He had a really good time. I think the most important thing for us was not to let him know how hurt WE were that all of his school friends bailed. Our neighbors told us that around here lots of kids don't come to parties. My son has been the only other kid at two birthday parties. So for what it's worth, it could be a sign of the times and not about your son. I do feel that around 10, traditional ""birthday parties"" start to die down. That was his 11th birthday. For 12 we went on a family outing and we'll probably do the same this year.

I’m so sorry you’re in this situation. First of all, I would take a step back and not jump to conclusions. This is a very busy time of year with activities and I bet it is due to conflicts- could be family in town, travel, sports, etc. What kind of party and what day and time? At this age the only party option I think that works is an evening party. Could you do a late over or sleepover? People can come later and leave early if they have activities. I have two kids and we are busy from 8am to 4pm Sat and Sun next few weeks. Also 2 weeks can be a little short notice. I would reach out and ask why and see if you could pivot and do something like what I suggested.
---
Did you text the invite, email, or was it paper? Apparently many paper invites don't get looked at. If it was sent via whattsap, then I'm sorry this happened. 
---
That’s so strange. Sorry that’s happening!! Any get together I’ve had for my kids/birthdY, we invite very few friends. Just their closest 2-4 and I contact the parent directly and build up the convo. Will have child remind their friend as well if parent hasn’t gotten back to me or just reminder of the day. I also try to keep it simple at home or right after school.

I think you need to focus on one thing at hand, here - and that's dealing with this party situation. Figure out what you're looking to spend on the day and find a way to convince him that you are going to do something REALLY COOL but oh no it's so expensive we can only bring one friend with us. So and so was the first friend to reply (not a lie) so we will bring them with us because that's fair.

Hold off on the rest of this. It could be timing. Here, everyone is sick and has been sick forever. Also next week is vacation week for us and a lot of people are busy/going away. Is it vacation week for you all, too?",2025-02-13 22:07:42,False
Parenting,kids off social media,How to deal with the extended family of an absent father,"My daughter will be 9 in 3 weeks. She hasn't seen her dad since December 2022 because his work kept him in other parts of the country for months at a time and when he would get back into town seeing my kid just wasn't a priority I guess. He would talk to her if she called him but he rarely initiated contact with her. About 1-2 years ago her dad changed his phone number and blocked me on all social media platforms. He hasn't called my daughter for holidays birthdays nothing in 2 years. I tell her it's because he's working and he's far away. I never talk bad about him and I do my best to make her feel like him not taking to her is not anything to do with her it's just the way his job is. Luckily she has a good step dad and grandfather and uncle that all love her very much and see her often and are very involved in her life so she is not really lacking a father figure.

I recently reached out to the dad's sister to say hey what's up with your brother going MIA? My daughter talks about him often. She said 'I don't know what his problem is but I want a relationship with my niece can I come get her and take her with me to her cousins soccer game? Maybe we'll even run into her dad'.... my daughter didn't want to go by herself because her aunt is a complete stranger to her at this point and she wasn't comfortable with . That's fine I'm not going to force her of course.

She's got 2 older siblings from her dad. When she was born until she was about 4 we saw the older kids a lot and they all loved spending time with each other. The sister is 24 now. When she turned 18 she left home and I'm pretty sure she is a sex worker but I don't know for sure. Whatever she's doing it's not working or going to school bottom line. Anyway my daughter asks about her brother and sister way more than she asks about her dad. She FaceTimes with her sister every once in awhile so she's not completely estranged. The sister just messaged me on Facebook asking if she could pick up my daughter tomorrow to take her to the aunts bday party. If I say yes my kids going to show up and see all her dads family but not her dad or her dad will be there and he'll be caught off guard.  I mean shit he might not even recognize her it's been so long and then what? My fear is that she will leave that party feeling even more rejected by her dad. Or she will start asking about him and wanting to see him again and he'll still be unavailable to her. Not to mention my apprehension about sending her in a car with her older sister. Help please I need advice on how to handle this I don't know what the right thing to do here its.

Something isn't right here and if she actually cared about your daughter she would be coming to her without you reaching out in the first place and also including you.

I think if it were me, I would start with a much smaller outing and I would be present. And add in family members slowly. There is absolutely no need for her to go and meet a thousand people at the same time and possibly run into her estranged dad. Take her sister out to dinner and all three of you can get to know each other a bit (if your daughter is up for it).

We ended up skipping the birthday party and meeting my daughter's sister at our local beach and boardwalk last night for some arcade games and shopping.

Parenting,kids off social media,My daughter only watches the same show on repeat ,"I will be the first to admit that I messed up with my daughter (9f) and her screen time habits, but I have been making an effort over the past few years to make repairs.

When she was younger and would watch tv, I didn't see anything wrong with her watching toy channels on YouTube. I figured it's just people playing with toys. Then that moved to nursery rhymes and before I knew it she was watching family vlogs and cocomelon and other garbage media. They seemed innocent enough on the surface, but I noticed her behavior was changing and not in a good way. So after learning WHY this type of media was so harmful, I shut it down. I restricted her screen time (on the tv, she didn't have a tablet) to two hours of traditional shows a day and one day a week she can watch approved channels YouTube for a few hours. The main reason I still let her watch it is because other kids on her school seem to have unlimited access to yt and social media and I don't want her to feel left out. This has worked for us for about 4 years now. 

It was a hard transition to make at first, but I was very happy with the results. She wasn't as emotional or reactive, she even started sleeping better. She is very good about respecting the rules, so this year we got her a tablet for her birthday. We thought it would be ok since she has been so responsible with her screen time and also because now she has a 2year old brother who she had to share the tv with and there was only so much Ms Rachel she could take.

A little while ago I peeked in and saw she was watching the Amazing World of Gumball. Not bad, I think it's a funny show. The next day I noticed she was watching the same episode again. Weird, but maybe she missed something and wanted to rewatch it. A little bit later I went to remind her that it was time to turn off the tablet and she was restarting the same episode again. Later I checked her watch history and she has only been watching the same three episodes of Gumball over and over again. 

I asked why she was only watching the same thing and she shrugged and said she didn't know. I said why don't we watch the next episode and she freaked out as though I was asking her to watch a horror movie. She's not autistic but she's not neurotypical either. I feel like this is definitely not good for her. I'm thinking about taking away the tablet altogether, but I'm also thinking I might be over reacting?",3,14,Used_Establishment92,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1esun2b/my_daughter_only_watches_the_same_show_on_repeat/,2024-08-15 13:03:52,"r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

May I ask why you automatically said, ""She's not autistic, but she's not neurotypical either"".  So, which is it? 

Honestly the title alone made me think autism. Are there other weird behaviors you've noticed, or her teachers have noticed? 

If she's not neurotypical, then what kind of neurodivergence does she have? If you don't know then it is time to find out. Parenting strategies are very different for neurodivergent children. Your child being ADHD or autistic is not a bad thing. There's no value judgment. Having all of the information can greatly help your child.
---
I'm an adult with autism and ADHD and I re-watch shows frequently. We call them 'comfort shows' and we watch them because they are entertaining but also predictable so it is easier to watch. My child is 2 and also likes to watch the same things when we watch tv, luckily I also enjoy cocomelon and Mighty Little Bheem lol

My autistic niece watches the same things repeatedly on her
tablet and gets super pissed if you try and take it away or change it to something else.  Have you taken her to a specialist?
---
“She’s not autistic but she’s not neurotypical either” it’s pretty normal for neurodivergent people to rewatch the same things over and over. It could be something as simple as anxiety, I do the same thing at times. 

After Avengers endgame came out I watched the same iron man movies daily for the whole summer and that’s just one example I have doing that. Sometimes we watch the same things over and over because it gives us comfort and control to know exactly what’s going to happen.",2024-08-15 13:03:52,False
AskAnAustralian,age verification social media Australia,Is it normal to have more than one conversation going in a group of four people? ,"I moved to Australia 12 years ago, and it’s starting to really grate on me that in a group setting of four people, if one person is speaking, the person closest to me starts a new conversation with me rather than the three people listening to the original person’s story. 

Am I strange in thinking this is incredibly annoying? I often really want to hear what each person has to say and if I catch a glimpse of what the other two were talking about and ask the person later, then the other two people are off talking about the next thing I want to hear! I understand if it were a social gathering with, say, more than 6 people that it would start to turn into a more party/mingle situation but 4 people? 

I don’t have any memory of this happening in the US. Does this happen in the US too? Some of the friends my age do it, and so does my (Australian) partner’s parents and their generation. And it’s not like the topics are gendered or uninteresting depending on the person listening, it’s multiple topics in different settings with multiple sets of people.

I don't think this is unique to Australia. Seems like a pretty normal group-of-people thing to me. 


 Is there a reason that you don't feel able to politely decline the 'new' conversation and continue attending to the original one? 


What is it about groups of 4 specifically that make you feel like certain social rules should be in play that don't apply to more than 4 people?
---
I just make sure it's very visible that I'm actively listening to the person speaking, even if they're more talking to someone else than me, doesn't matter, I'm interested in the story. Often I can see out the corner of my eye ""that"" person realising they can't/shouldn't bother trying to start a separate convo with me. When they do anyway I'll ""not hear"" what they said and make them repeat it so they at least realise they interrupted me being invested in the other story and maybe they'll feel a bit bad (I'm a passive aggressive bitch)

privacy,age verification social media Australia,Weird data broker Socure: correcting and interpreting my data?,"I wanted to share my experience requesting my data from the shadowy data broker Socure. You can request your data and read about their process here: [Data Protection Rights Request Form - Socure Inc.](https://www.socure.com/datarights)

This might be overly niche, but I can't find much of anything specific out there so I figured it might be helpful.

**I could also use your help.** Context is below, but here are my questions:

1. **Is there anyone out there who has** requested their data, corrected it, or worked with this data in their job?
2. **Do you know how to correct bad data?** I didn't see anything explicit on their site about that, but they seem to be set up to comply with the CCPA and similar laws so I think they probably would let me depending on what state I'm in?
3. **Do you have any advice on how to interpret this report?** It came in multiple unlabeled files. The contents of most files seem self-explanatory, but a lot of the records are unlabeled. For example, I see an address I've never heard of in one of the files, but it's in a separate file with a bunch of addresses. So maybe they aren't saying it's my address, maybe they are saying it's the address of someone I did business with or something. I'm really not sure.

i pretty much asked these same questions to Socure today, along with some others.

**So here is my story:**

* I went to that link above to request my report.
* I got an email back saying that I should expect a selfie verification text message within 24 hours.
* I got that text message and passed selfie verification pretty easily.
   * This is notable because I just failed some kind of Socure check that also involved selfie verification. This was with a bank. That fail was the reason I requested my report.
* Then I got another email saying that I would get my report within 45 days of the original request.
* But I actually got it about 15 weeks after the request instead of 45. Hell yeah! Thanks to the folks working my case.

**Here's what was in my report:**

* They said that they might redact some things, but I didn't see anything redacted.
* They gave me a link to a secure portal where I could download an encrypted zip file. The filename of the zip file was my initials, and it contained 5 JSON files called 0.json, 1.json and so on.
* Each json file contained a number of records.
   * One was a list of IP addresses. It seemed legit based on the recent locations, but I didn't check them all.
   * Two were pretty self-explanatory and looked like generic identity info, like addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, SSN, driver's license, etc. I'm not sure why there were two. These included some incorrect name and address information that I removed from ChexSystems by dispute earlier this year.
   * One was similar but had a way longer list of addresses that I've never heard of, except for one wrong address which I removed from ChexSystems by dispute earlier this year. **This is the one I would like to correct.**
   * One was a weird file which I reproduce below. Does anyone have any idea what this one might be?

I've always despised snapchat, for many reasons; sexting culture, blatant illegal data usage\[1\], advertising, sponsored stories, personal info/""telemetry"" gathering, and most other social media issues. I've previously deleted Insta/TikTok/Facebook from my phone both for privacy concerns and to hinder my addiction to social media, but snapchat has been impossible to delete. The majority of people my age including most of my friends use snapchat as a primary means of communication so It's been hard to get rid of it.

SocialMedia,young people and social media ban,Strategies for Monetizing Social Media: Insights and Real-Life Experiences ?,"Hello Everyone,  
  
I've been closely watching the trend of people using platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok to generate income. This leads me to wonder about the mechanics behind their success. Is it primarily through trial and error, or do they follow a structured strategy that others can replicate?  
  
Here are my specific questions:  
  
   1. Is there a systematic approach that successful content creators use to monetize their presence on these platforms, or is it largely about experimenting until finding a profitable method?  
2. How do content creators generate income from these platforms? Is it through direct payments from the platforms, advertising revenue, partnerships, or by leveraging their online presence to sell services and products?  
3. In the context of partnerships, how are these typically structured, and what makes them successful?  
4. What role do online courses and podcasts play in a content creator's growth and monetization strategy on social media? Are these essential elements to consider?  
5. Can anyone share real-life experiences or practical advice on integrating social media into an income-generating strategy?

Just saw a kid on instagram it was a reel I guess and it was just her smiling and stuff the comments were horrible,  extremely horrible I never expected this cause it wasn't even typical instagram rude comments, people were literally sexualizing that little girl I just can't understand why someone would ever say things like that about a toddler?
I hope instagram get banned .
When instagram started becoming so annoying I Uninstalled it , I have to deactivat it for some personal reason and instagram is more scary now)
Not even a animal Is safe from social media now.

I always wondered is there any ways to make social media a better place not just my for you page but everyones. I know apps like Instagram and stuff are all about business than actually caring about the users life and stuff

But is it possible?
Technology is always growing right?
Is there anyway we could create a AI or something to automatically remove bad comments and stuff
I have reported and sended plenty of emails to social medias when I see horrible comments or post that affect someone'. That reporting button is so useless now. 

I might sounds stupid cause of my english and why I'm even worrying about topics like this

And In most countries you can take someone's picture and now you own it cause of copyright thing
I think it's such a bad idea to make it legal
It's ok if people's face ain't that visible 
Buy if it is visible enough to cut their face and paste it on nudes and stuff it shouldn't be allowed to posted on social media without that person's permission If you weren't able to get their permission just blur their face

Some people don't blur others face cuz it's actually legal to film in public but in this ugly era of social media anyone can be hurt

No one should be able to post someone else's photos on social media if they requested you to No to cause anyone can turn into a meme material and it might make many laugh or whatever but definitely ruin life too.

I wish social media was more strict atleast on youtube they turn off comments if the content include kids 

And no one should be able to repost without someone's permission they can of course download or screen shot pics but no one should be able to post pics without their permission cause that's terrible.
It's annoying and Is invasive even tho it's legal to post pictures of u if a random person took it without your permission it's still owned by that person idk why the government even allow that it's invasive and horrible 
Photography should be encouraged but should not affect anyone's life badly

Everyone has different standards. Societies and cultures have different definitions of morality. You're asking for one company to cater for 8bn people individually. Impossible.

I would say no. Especially these days when social media = money, and not just sharing stuff with your friends. 

Social media posts are now successful depending on how much interaction you get on your post. So many are purposefully done to get reactions out of people, and negative things get attention. 

Whether that's an opinion, a spelling mistake (to get people pointing out how dumb you are) or just rage baiting. And especially with bots these days who try and argue, again for more interactions and attention. More views equals more money. 

I'm sure in theory it would be easy to solve at least 90% of the issues. But the people running social media have kind of ruined it. Plus now they're also too greedy and money hungry - just scroll through and look at how many ads you're spammed with.

They are making money from sponsors. Even if they are in not monetized countries, if they have high engagement and high number of views they can make decent money from sponsors. Also, even though they live in countries where TikTok is not monetized, they can use profile that someone created from countries where TikTok is monetized. They can still make money that way. Maybe they use other apps which do not have country restrictions like Tapkeen.

Now he doesn't have a place he can safely vent with out judgement

He needs a space to be angry without causing harm. Let him talk shit with his friends. Let him play video games or whatever that’s safe.

Personally anytime my parents limited me I started thinking more extreme. Get him into a sport like soccer so he can make friends and spend his energy focused on something positive. Give him resources. Send him to the ymca for indoor soccer night etc. 

Give him a chance to form this into something healthy instead of just punishing him with a digital break.

>How can I set my girls up so that they're not wierdos for being off the grid?



I don't think you can beyond a certain age.  Like you can probably keep them off phones until middle school but around that time if they don't have the same means to interact with their peers they'll likely face some ostracizing.


I think the best thing you can do is have open and honest conversations as they're growing up about the Internet and social media and the reasons they're dangerous, keep em out of it for as long as possible, and monitor it to some degree once they do have a smart phone.
---
It's been normalized in elementary schools for kids to have phones and access to Tik Tok, Youtube, and Roblox. Literal babies go to daycare with tablets because they refuse to eat or nap without it. I am not even worrying about teens at this point, I'm worrying about my small children. I was exposed to awful things growing up when parental control was not really a thing, I want my children away from it as long as possible.

My kids are very young (4 and 2), but they attend Montessori school and have playdates often, and so far, all the parents have similar views to mine when it comes to screens. It's very early on, but I am hopeful for the future and thankful for the like-minded community.

We do no smartphones until high school and no social media until 16. I don't need a community to follow.

Parenting,Australia under 16 social media ban,What are the consequences of only one parent being more attentive than the other? ,"My son’s father and I live together with my parents after we gave up our apartment. We broke up mainly because I was tired of trying to “parent” him and my son. He left me to do majority of the housework (I’m a SATM until I finish my education for a better job) care for our son, finding health insurance for him, keeping up with his appointments, giving him his medication, remembering when to give him his medication, bath time, walks, grocery shopping, literally everything. I got to the point where I told him I was done. His excuse was he “works”. He works 3 days a week and the rest of the days he plays video games or scrolls on social media. I became fed up. I told him If I was going to be a single mother while still in a relationship, I didn’t need him. 

I have told him multiple times that we need more income. That I was trying to finish my education so I could get my certification for being a pharmacy technician. This was something we previously talked about and he was okay with. I told him if I went back to work now, I would not be able to focus on school. His excuse is “I’ve been working since I was 16, I’m tired” or “my job doesn’t have work available so I can’t do anything about that” I told suggested to him to work a retail job, or apply for a line cook. He said “I hate retail jobs or dead end jobs” i mean so do I but I did it while pregnant before we moved with my parents. It’s excuse after excuse after excuse. So I left him to his own devices.

When he finally did start looking for new jobs, he said “I can’t wait to get this new job because then I can buy a PS4 and new games.” Not once did he ever mention to provide for our son. 

Now that he see’s how distant I’ve become he’s been trying to pick up the pace. At the same time I know it’s only to get in my good graces until things are good between us again. After that, he will fall into the same routine once he’s comfortable again. He’s done this before, I won’t fall for it again.
 
Lately I’ve noticed whenever he’s watching our some while I study, he’s on his phone watching Netflix or anime. I have to continue to get up and engage with our son so he feels wanted and not like a burden. What are the long term effects of not being attentive with your child? All I care about is the development of our son. If he is going to damage that in anyway then I need to know. That way, I can tell him to leave now while he’s still young. 

I’ve told him to leave previously before. He always refuses because he “wouldn’t be able to see his son enough” yet while he has the opportunity to, he’s distracted on video games, or watching media on his phone. That’s a contradiction. He will tell me “he needs his dad” yes, he needs an ATTENTIVE, PRESENT, dad. Just because your DNA is in him and you’re his biological son doesn’t make you a dad. My best friend has given me money for diapers when my son’s father and I couldn’t afford them, money for wipes, or whatever else my son needed. He even educated himself about parenting terminology like object consistency, infant social cues, and giving me advice on how to use positive discipline and how to develop a secure attachment that his mom used on her children. Offered to take my son and I to a local bookstore to take him to the children’s section and buy him a kids book. 

That was my final straw of why we broke up and I refuse to get back with my son’s father. The fact my best friend is doing more for my son  than his father is mind boggling. 

Thank you for reading. I’m sorry for getting off track on the question. I needed to vent. I’ve been holding this inside for far too long.

i currently go to university in canada and have siblings/friends studying in the UK and the US, so im pretty familiar with university life in those countries (as i was about to go there myself as well). when i was applying to universities, i was seriously considering australia but genuinely didn’t know much about it or knew any close people to me that went there. from what i’ve heard, it can be a little bit isolating and most people live at home and commute to university so there isn’t really a sense of “community”, or that whole idea of moving away alone at the age of 18. why is it like this? is it to do with the geography of the country?

We mostly just show up to class on time and then leave shortly after it's finished. There isn't too much of a ""hang around on campus just to socialise"" type of atmosphere, really. Most people want to get in and get out. Occasionally use the facilities to do an assignment/study.

Dorms are pretty average share houses and fairly expensive. Most students will elect for a shared rental off campus and the University can help you look for one.

We also have fairly little in the way of alumni engagement. Most people forget their uni after they walk out the door. People dont tend to keep wearing their Uni Name branded hoodie as a badge of honour, merely as clothes that happen to have their name on it. 

Other than an employer, I have never had anyone in a social circle ask about where I got my degree.
---
Universities across the same “tier” are fairly similar, so there isn’t really that much difference in the offerings for the ones you will get into from state to state.  

The only course that you see a significant number of students leaving home for undergrad if they live in a capital city is medical students.   Usually from the more populous states (Victoria/New South Wales) to the less populous ones, just because of how the MBBS places are distributed.

If you’re from a rural area you tend to move to the closest big city if you go to university.


Moreover, almost all the Universities are in the capital cities, we don’t have “college towns”

The 'dorm life' experience isn't the norm but it does exist - I lived on campus at University of Newcastle for two years and it was a very lively experience - lots of social events, parties, drinking, etc. It's a great way to find friends and community if you're moving to a new city with no connections. Lots of international students but plenty of Australians from other parts of the country too.
---
Everyone I know that lived in a dorm was an international student, then they all found share houses together for their second year. Rent for a tiny, crappy dorm room with kitched shared between like, 30 people is pretty high. You can split rent between 3 or 4 people for an actual house and pay less. I don't know many Aussies that lived at home for uni though, a couple, but most again found share housing with friends (I did). I didn't find it isolating, ""uni night"" at a local bar was a thing (cheap beer for students on Wednesdays), on weekends it was a different bar that we all went to, or the uni had it's own bar and lots of cultural/fun events to go to. So there was always ways to be around people.

Is university prestige a thing here at all? You either go where is convenient or offers the course you want to do.

Get a program like bark that monitors app usage and alerts parents if something dangerous flags (for example chats that take a turn towards the child being targeted by a predator).

Set up parental controls with time limits on apps, or usage altogether. 

Most important - phone charges overnight in your room; inaccessible for your child's sleeping hours. 

Talk with your child about the importance of saving ALL chats/messages so that if they ever get cyberbullied or accused of cyberbullying they have a complete history with context for the incident. If you allow snapchat, help them navigate settings to auto save all chats.

Absolutely not. How hard is it to lie about your age?

No one is going to agree with me on this, but screens have caused serious harm to kids (digital dementia, along with political extremism, failure to establish a social support network, etc).

Parents aren't protecting their kids from screens, hell we can barely protect ourselves. This is a societal level issue.

I think scrollable media should be banned, and people should have their ID verified and openly connected to all social media profiles. There should be consequences for false flagging, trolling, and spreading lies online. If someone engages in this behaviour, others should be able to see that and call them out.

I'm considering heading down there next February for a semester, and I'm super excited about the idea. However, there's one big question on my mind: which city and university should I choose?  
  
The universities I'm looking at is:

* University of Sydney
* University of Technology Sydney
* Monash University 
* RMIT Melbourne
* Queensland University of Technology

What I'm looking for is a city that offers not just a great educational experience, but also a vibrant social scene.

Of course, it's also super important that the university itself is top-notch, with good teachers and a supportive learning environment.

In addition to my studies, I'm planning to travel around Australia either before or after the semester. 

I’ve never been to Australia, so I’m all ears for any advice or experiences you can share. Which city would you recommend for someone like me who's looking for both academic excellence and a lively social life? Any insights into the universities or the cities would be incredibly helpful.

Sydney and Brisbane are MUCH sunnier/warmer, with much easier access to national parks and beaches. I'd very very much suggest you consider these, especially as a European! Brisbane is more laid back, and a bit smaller. But the city centre is also very nice. In any case you'll get very different experiences in every city, and you should definitely see them all when you visit. Good luck.

Can't really go wrong with any of those. USyd, UTS and RMIT are in better locations within their cities.

My RMIT days were the best. I knew no one and was unfamiliar with the city. It's In the CBD, and so many students in the city, lots to do and loads of people to meet. You will definitely find the education and the nightlife/Student life with RMIT. Melbourne is easy to navigate, easy to get transport, lots of student accommodation and lots of students share-housing in rentals. It's got everything as far as night-life and food and festivals. 

Monash in Melbourne is further out of the city, and doesn't have the same amount of transport or night-life.

I can't comment of the others.

University of Sydney is easily the best in your list. Its probably the most beautiful in Australia, has very extensive list of social clubs for activities. Its also located right in the heart of Sydney's nightlife area of Newtown and a big green campus. 

UTS is a significant step down even though its nearby and closer to the city, its much more urban with a smaller more highrise campus and standard level of social life.

teenagers,Albanese social media ban,guys are my parents parenting?,"I cannot make a good title for the life of me 😞

hey everyone I just wanted to get someone else's opinion on whether my parents are okay or not  if im just going insane right now 😭🙏

for context im 15 (I turn 16 in like 2 months)

-no makeup until I turn 18 or when I go to uni (my mum tried to push this down to 16 but my dad said no) and absolutely under no circumstances am I allowed to wear fake eyelashes 

-ik its kind of related to the statement on top but no nails. No press ons, acrylic, gel, normal nail polish or even CLEAR nail polish 

-i am not allowed to go to the mall with my friends or talk take a longer bus route w/h them after school

-no boys until I graduate or turn 18 ig

- i cannot have any guy friends (I kind of see the point in this one but I had one guy friend and we used to talk about school and my mum gave me a 30 minute talk session abt how bad boys are 💀 

- i cannot move out of the house until I get married (im still going to probably move out anyway)

-any personal personal  belongings such as diaries of notebooks where I write about my deepest darkest secrets are shared with the family since i do not need ""privacy""  (my dad said that btw)

- i am not allowed to have any LGBT friends (idgaf about this rule because I will be friends with people I like and if they identify that way then that's okay! and like 80% of my friends are in this community)

-no multi-player video games (my dad banned roblox)

-no social media platforms

- limited screen time. at one point it was 30 minutes. 30 MINUTES. I hate family link so much.

-no proactive stuff (this one makes sense but then I realized that I can't step outside in shorts. Shorts that reach my ankles  BTW.

- more on the last point but if I wanted to wear it skirt it has to be halfway my feet AND ankles because i go to a uniform school.

-even more on the last point but my parents dress me. They dress ME. for example if we wanted to go to church they would pick a tight fitted polo shirt for me. (I fucking hate shirts like that because it's not my style and skinny jeans or smth like that) and I look like a grandpa that plays golf all day.  and they are fully aware that i hate it because I would cry sometimes (yes I am that sensitive 💀🙏)

-if i did find something i like they would mock me for it if THEY didn't like it.

-also i low key had a panic attack because they were yelling at me and my dad mocked me for it 😭🙏 and my mum would tell me things like no one marry me if I don't know how to cook 💔 (I burn water)

-no therapy (super ultra religious parents) they belive that I will spiral (what the heck that means 😔💔)

sorry for going of in a rant at the end but I need to know from strangers on the internet  do you guys have any advice?  the weird thing is that I've love them but sometimes I feel like I'm genuinely tweaking ",3,9,stronombolini,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1hoow2t/guys_are_my_parents_parenting/,2024-12-29 05:15:38,"This has to be worse than North Korea

This is bad, how are you supposed to develop as a person if you can´t do anything? Hopefully you somehow can convince them that they are in the wrong. Sorry you find yourself in this situation, wish you luck in life.",2024-12-29 05:15:38,True
teenagers,Albanese social media ban,"If you live in Utah, you may be permanently banned from social media","In March 2024, Utah is passing a law that bans under 18 from using social media without parental consent. I don’t live in Utah tho. Utah also bans teens from using it between 10:30 PM and 6:30 AM. You may be affected if you live in Utah if this bill passes.

teenagers,let kids be kids campaign,idk who need this but here’s the entire bee movie script ,"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Oandy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Ooming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There's a bee in the car! - Do something! - I'm driving! - Hi, bee. - He's back here! He's going to sting me! Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this. What was that? Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Oan I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Oome on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?"" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet. What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Orazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose blood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours. - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee! - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit. What is this place? A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey, and we make the money. ""They make the honey, and we make the money""? Oh, my! What's going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn't last too long. Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! Bee honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to humans. - What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! Make out? Barry! We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you want to do with your life? I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees! Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop. I remember that. What right do they have to our honey? We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever! Even if it's true, what can one bee do? Sting them where it really hurts. In the face! The eye! - That would hurt. - No. Up the nose? That's a killer. There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters. Hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source. No more bee beards! With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Ohung. - Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Ohung. A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally! Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson. Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this""? Bees have never been afraid to change the world. What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans. We were thinking of stickball or candy stores. How old are you? The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century. You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too. It's a common name. Next week... He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots... Next week... Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em. Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live. Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish. In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81. Honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that? Quiet, please. Actual work going on here. - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is! I'm helping him sue the human race. - Hello. - Hello, bee. This is Ken. Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe. Why does he talk again? Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working. But it's our yogurt night! Bye-bye. Why is yogurt night so difficult?! You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours! Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help. - Frosting... - How many sugars? Just one. I try not to use the competition. So why are you helping me? Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now. Those are great, if you're three. And artificial flowers. - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too. Bent stingers, pointless pollination. Bees must hate those fake things! Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done. Maybe this could make up for it a little bit. - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess. You sure you want to go through with it? Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty! It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here, Barry? It's pretty big, isn't it? I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day. You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers? Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade. - What's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill. Well, if it isn't the bee team. You boys work on this? All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Oase number 4475, Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively? A privilege. Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world? I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids! Mr. Benson? Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice! Oall your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have. I suppose so. I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron! Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.

[Relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceForTeens/?f=flair_name%3A%22Relationships%22)

I (17)F had a friend who was (16) we are both females. the friendship started way back when i was in year 12 and she was in year 11. The friendship started as result of us knowing that somehow we had the same friend group although we have never met, we added each other on all social media. Slowly the friendship grew and we became close friends, along the way I feel in love with her but I didn't tell i confided in my friend. She was always they for me through the ups and downs and sometimes i feel like she knew that i was in love with her, we were back to school from holidays and started to notice that she had started being cold to me, she removed me from her social media. A day before my brother's graduation she calls me and confronts me over rumours that she overheard and I was involved I explained my part and I thought it was all over a day later she comes into my room with my friend to confront me over the same issue I give the same explanation I did over the phone.

Some months later a friend comes to me and tells me that when the call happened i was on loudspeaker and all the girls were listening. I did take upon myself to apologies the first time cause it was really hurting that I lost a true friend that I would confide in. She accepted the apology I thought things would be at least casual but no things got more awkward. Several months later i did apologies again and this time she accepted and slowly she started saying hi and eventually se added me back on social media although the friendship didn't go back as before i was still in love with her all along.

I later came on came to have a one one conversation with her where she told me where she had all the rumours from and it was the friend who had confided in about my feelings for her. I tried to initiate us having a relationship but i came to hear from another person that she's dating it does hurt to this day. I do check up on her daily but am the one whose always initiation conversations but when i go silent she comes back acting all nice and when i seem interested she goes off on me. When i talk to a specific person she doesn't like she comes back acting all nice.

teenagers,Australia under 16 social media ban,Is this abuse?,"So I’m 18, and was caught smoking weed. It’s not legal where I live. But when I got caught I did not expect to be treated this way, my mam caught me smoking, fine. Was ready for a scolding and a slap on the wrist and maybe having the family car keys taken away, that’s reasonable enough. But I’ve been banned from going out, seeing my mates outside college. (I live at home still which is pretty normal for uni students in Ireland with rents) They are also forbidding me from drinking alcohol or going to  college social events where drinking might be involved, that’s weird but ok. But the kicker came when my mam is trying to get me to transfer all my savings to her because “I can’t be trusted”. I’m not blowing 6k on ganja ever. That’s crazy shit. What’s more is that my uncle asked for a lift back from the pub tomorrow night and I asked if I was good to give him the lift, was told no. That pissed me off but ok, but my dad told me to tell him why I’m not allowed. I didn’t because fuck that, I’m not going to publicly flog and shame myself. They’re trying to destroy my reputation because I smoked pot… I’m not a coke fiend, not a fan or the special K or anything, never touched those and never will because there’s a fucking difference. 

I feel like they don’t trust me to be an adult and make adult choices, they told me they had me on a “loose leash” before but only last night I thought about how fucked up it is to have an adult on a leash.  They claimed to be real “liberal” before letting me drink u18, sure some parents won’t that’s fair, but whenever I did I had to tell them before hand etc, I’m starting to think this isn’t about safety moreso controlling my life, my mam fake cries sometimes to emotionally tear me into doing things for her, my dad is a former Olympian and wanted me to be an athlete and I was for years, I even represented my country for ages but then I got T1D (type 1 diabetes) and found it too hard to keep up with the healthy lads who were training still. This fucked my head up even more. Cut to a year later and I’m on anti depressants and doing better for the most part. I decided I’m in college, I’m a grown adult, I want to try smoke weed. See what it’s like. Was caught on my second time. They tore me a new one the next day claiming that I’ve changed over 18 months and am a major disappointment etc. I don’t feel welcome in this house anymore, I don’t want to live in a situation where my own parents are disgusted by me for something so fucking minor 

I can’t move out, rent in Ireland is extortionate, I might look into FIFO in Australia (free accommodation and decent money for young lads yk) and just leave over-night, but that would mean I’d have to drop out of college In A course I really like. I’m stuck in a situation where my personal freedoms are being taken away at the threat of homelessness (implied) and the emotional manipulation and shaming is really tearing me up. I have been cold to them since and they think the issue is the fact that I’m not “off the weed” (btw, they know ppl that used to smoke when they were younger, I know that they know but they’re denying it)


This is such a fucking rant but I’m so unhappy right now, I don’t have a girlfriend who’s house I can stay at etc so I’m curfewed and required to be home at certain times like a child. This isn’t right or am I crazy?",3,29,No-Rough4635,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1hcwf3y/is_this_abuse/,2024-12-12 21:50:33,"This thread has been flaired as [Serious].

teenagers,Albanese social media ban,My dad is a “social media influencer”,"So, my dad - who is in his late 50s - has been having way too much fun on social media. He mainly uses TikTok and Facebook, and he keeps saying he’s an influencer. What he means by that is he has accounts that get up to 1000 or so followers, and all he does is post conservative memes, some he even makes himself.

His TikTok (the one time I checked it out) was hilarious for all the wrong reasons; all of his posts were still images, and every single one had Thunderstruck by AC/DC in the background. And I mean: Every. Single. One. All Thunderstruck, all the time.

His Facebook is his crown jewel though - for years, he’s been using accounts under fake names, posting his memes, and trolling (harassing) people on our town’s local pages. It’s gotten to the point where people in town are trying to figure out who this asshole is, but they keep coming up short. A lot of his accounts end up getting banned - whether because of the insensitive right wing content or the “trolling,” I’m not sure - but he’s quick to set up another one and keep doing his thing.

teenagers,Online Safety Amendment Act 2024,S my roommate spying on me ?,"Hey guys, I'm not usually the type of person to ask for advice on the internet but I don’t really know what to do right now. I don't want to be like one of those recipe pages where they tell you their entire life story before actually getting to the recipe, but in order to help me I think it's important to get some background on my situation.

I met my roommate, we’ll call them Cameron, online. I know what you're thinking, I had kinda signed up for some weird shit rooming with some rando. The reason I resorted to finding someone online instead of asking a friend is that a
A) I don't have a lot of friends, and B) The few friends I do have either want to live alone or live with their partner/family so I didn't really have a choice and C) I am not really in contact with my family right now. I would live on my own if I could, but I am currently working as an intern and barely make enough to scrape by. 

This is how I ended up on the “looking for roommates in their 20s” facebook page. Cameron messaged me first, and I thought it was really weird that they didn't have any facebook friends nor a profile picture, but I thought the polite thing to do was respond. However, we got to talking and it seemed like we had a lot in common - we both are okay with clutter as long as it is not gross (i.e moldy food or poorly unkempt bathrooms/hygiene), and loved cats, horror movies, and time to recharge on our own. 

Cameron told me that they specifically made their facebook page to find a roommate and isnt really interested in having a social media presence which is why there is very little info on their page. I can respect that, sometimes I wish I never got my first facebook account at 13 and relished unrestricted internet access. 

Cameron said that they were just moving into the cities this year from a small farming town up north and was a little nervous about living in the cities for the first time. After talking more, we decided to meet up in person. We agreed to meet at a small diner halfway between their current home and mine, which still ended up being a 2 hour drive. They had gotten there first, and when they stood up to greet me I was stunned as they did not look like I expected them to. Cameron was tall, muscular, and incredibly attractive. Their pale blue eyes seemed to glow in the dark and their teeth lined up as straight and uniform as a military cemetery. 

I found myself jealous, as my eyes were dark brown (and not the pretty dark brown like puppy dog eyes, like sewer water brown) and never got braces when I should have. After I got over my initial shock, I bustled my way over to try to cover up my reaction. We shook hands and sat across from one another in an old booth that seemed incredibly worn but still felt welcoming. 

We discussed our desired living situation: how many bathrooms, did we need a dishwasher or in unit laundry, was AC necessary, are we okay with pets, rent budget, and neighborhood we wanted to live in. Cameron appeared to be the perfect roommate, agreeing with everything I said I was looking for in an apartment. I readily accepted their offer to move in together.

We found the perfect apartment and started moving in 2 months after we first started talking on facebook. Neither of us had much so we were able to move all of our things ourselves without having to rent a moving van. Our layout looked something like this: our bedrooms were linked with a jack and jill bathroom that had plenty of space for 2 people to keep their things and get ready at the same time. The front door opened up into the living room with the closet containing the washer and dryer to the immediate right. The kitchen was to the left and there was a small island between the kitchen and living room. I already had 2 cats, Seymour and Audrey, that Cameron was very happy to live with. At first glance, it seemed like we were going to be great roommates.

Okay, sorry for rambling. I just want to show that everything was normal at first. Our lives intertwined seamlessly - I left for work before they got up, and they got home when I was starting to get ready for bed. We would occasionally eat dinner together on the weekends and play video games and watch movies and stuff, and sometimes go out for a beer. That is how it was for the first 5 months or so - until I noticed the hole in my bedroom wall. I saw it after I started to hang things up on that wall and noticed a small chip in the paint. I inspected it, as I did not notice it when we were filling out the form with all the damages from before we moved in so they wouldn't be counted when we got our security deposit back. 

As I looked at it more closely, I saw something that reflected off of my lamp for just a second. I got my phone to use as a flashlight and spotted a small, round, black object that was no bigger than a peppercorn. The hole was too small to reach in with my fingers, so I started searching for things small enough to grab whatever it was. I tried everything I could think of: tweezers, tooth pics, tape, pliers, cotton swabs, you name it. Eventually I gave up and just went to bed.

I couldn't sleep that night, all I could do was stare at the ceiling and think about what it could be. After a few hours of tossing and turning - i decided that if i couldn't get it out, i have to make the hole bigger. I wasn't too worried about the security deposit since the hole was already made, what difference does it make if it's just a little bit bigger?

I didn't have any tools, so I dug around until I found a small pocket knife that my grandpa got me as a souvenir from Alaska. It said, in all caps, “I LOVE MY GRANDPA!!” I slowly made the hole bigger until it was enough to pull the object out with my tweezers. I celebrated as soon as i got it out, until i realized what it was.

It was a pin camera.

I only recognized it because I worked as a tour guide for a spy museum one summer. My mind went blank before the sirens in my head started going off. What the fuck was this? Who put it here? Is it the landlord watching us? Was there a person living in the ceiling that only came out when we were gone? My brain reeled with possibilities, mostly related to situations in different horror movies I had seen (I had just watched 13 Cameras last week), but one thing was certain: I had to search the apartment for other cameras. I just have to wait until Cameron is gone.

05/11/2024

Cameron is gone for the weekend visiting family. We had previously discussed that it would be okay to quickly run into each other's rooms if needed, like if the cats were going crazy or we needed to borrow something. I hadn't had a reason to go into their room yet, but I had to see if there was a camera in their room too. I didn't want to freak them out without evidence. I opened their door and was a little surprised at the lack of furniture. 

Cameron had a twin size mattress on the floor without a bed frame, a small desk, and a wooden cutting board that they must have been using as a bedside table. There was nothing on any of the walls, no lamps, and no TV or computer that I could see. It was the polar opposite of my room (it looked like it was straight out of howl's moving castle). I was relieved that I didn't have to move a ton of furniture or take things off of the wall though. I started on the wall next to the bathroom where mine was and when I didn't find it I started searching up and down every wall.

Nothing.

As soon as I started to walk out, I realized I hadn't looked in the closet yet. I went over and pulled open the sliding door and froze. The clothes in their closet were almost the same as mine. I closed the door and left. I was a little weirded out, but we had a similar job and we never saw each other wearing anything other than pajamas or sweatpants so I chalked it up to a coincidence. 

Anyways, I left their room and softly closed the door. I leaned against it and took a deep breath - half relieved and half terrified. It was good that Cameron wasn’t being targeted, but that meant that someone was watching me specifically.

05/21/2024

After our last conversation, I'm pretty sure it's Cameron.

The next saturday that we were both home, I decided to bring it up. I brought them into my room and showed them the hole and the camera. They said, “what the fuck dude, thats messed up” but his face showed little emotion. I suspected they were just in shock, as I was when I found it. Then I told them I had gone into their room. They became rigid and slowly turned their whole body at me, as if they were one solid being without joints or limbs. They stared at me and I felt their eyes in my soul as they blazed with an emotion I can't name - fear? Hatred? Confusion? I wasn't sure.

“You went in my room?” they asked coldly. I guess it was more of a statement than a question, but I answered them anyways

“Yeah, I wanted to make sure that there were no cameras in your room so you didn't freak out and tear apart your room trying to find one. I didn't find any though, I guess they're only interested in me'' I laughed, trying to avoid the fear that was striking its way through my veins.

“You. went. In. my. Room.”

“Uh.. yeah?” I was confused. This was something clearly stated in our roommate agreement that we could go into each other's rooms if necessary.

“Did you see anything weird in there”

“I just told you I didn't see any cameras. Don't worry, your room seems normal”

“Okay” silence filled the space between us. I stood under Camerons gaze, feeling as though I were being dissected. Then, Cameron flashed their 100 watt smile.

“Good,” they said. “I can help you search your room and the rest of the place for other cameras?” 

We searched our apartment top to bottom. Nothing. While I was still on edge, I felt better knowing it was the only one. Maybe it was left over from a previous resident freak? I decided to plug the camera into my computer to see if there was any footage on it. Thankfully, it seemed like it was really outdated and had no data on it. I threw the camera away, but decided it would be a good idea to put a small camera in my room to see if anyone strange came in or out. I didn't think to tell Cameron about it since it was my room, and it was a good thing I didn't.

06/13/2024

After a few weeks of recording, I decided to review the footage. It was mostly normal stuff: me on my computer, sleeping, cleaning, etc. that is, until the second week.

The door to my room creaked open slowly and a large figure began to walk through the darkness. My breath refused to come out of my lungs as my heart pulsated. When the light turned on, I felt like I was having a heart attack.

It was Cameron.

They started by doing a quick scan of the room before opening my closet. They didn’t do anything, just stared at it as if he was taking pictures with his mind. They did this all around my room, spending the most time looking at the pictures of me and my friends/family on my desk. After a few minutes, they turned off the light and quietly left my room.

After that, I really didn’t know what to do or how to interact with them. I tried to keep it cool but I could tell that I was acting weird, they didn’t say anything about it and went on as usual. I decided to do some background research on them (something I should have done in the first place).

I started easy by googling their name. I knew they didn’t have a social media presence but I still expected something to come up: a LinkedIn profile, a news article, a mention in a dean’s list or something - but absolutely nothing came up. I thought maybe I didn’t spell their last name right, so I decided to look at their ID when they were in the shower. I quietly went to the basket in the entryway where we keep our wallets and keys and slid the ID out of its pocket and froze.

Cameron’s name was not the one printed on the ID.

The picture was definitely them, the blonde hair and wide smile - but the eye color description said BRO, not BLU. I looked closely at the picture and realized that instead of their piercing blue eyes, it looked like the person in the picture had brown eyes. I quickly took a picture of their ID and put everything back as I had found it and escaped to my room.

I decided to google the name on the ID. Sure enough, a fair amount of information popped up. Whoever this person is seems to be a carefree and easy going person with lots of pictures of them with friends and family. I sighed in relief when I clicked on the facebook profile as it was public. I started from the bottom and scrolled through their posts. Most of it was the normal stuff: happy birthday wishes, memories from years prior, pictures of them at events and stuff.

I couldn’t help but notice their eyes. Again, they were not the piercing blue that I have come to know - they were brown, like a puppy staring at you with unconditional admiration. I didn’t think that Cameron wore contacts and I never saw any in our bathroom.

The final post was dated 2 years ago. It said: 

“Can’t wait to move into my new apartment! My new roommate Cameron is the best!!”

Posted with the update was a picture of the person with the brown eyes and another person that I did not recognize at first, until I noticed their piercing blue eyes.

Cameron’s eyes.

I have no words to describe what I was feeling at that moment. My heart sank so deep into my body I thought I would shit it out. I closed my laptop and stared at the wall, my thoughts coursing through my head so fast that it felt like I wasn’t thinking at all.

I decided to just go to bed.

UPDATE:
Hi, I know it has been a while since I posted this and I have to say I am very embarrassed about it. Turns out our apartment had a carbon monoxide leak and I was hallucinating. I am out of the hospital now, thankfully Cameron was at work when this happened and came home to find me passed out. I am not very internet savvy so I am not sure how to edit or delete this post but I did figure out how to comment.I just wanted to update and reassure you all that I am OK! I have decided to move back to my hometown to spend time with my family to take my mind off of things. Cameron is sad but understanding and is looking for a roommate. Attached below is a screenshot of their facebook if you are in the area and looking for a roommate!

teenagers,social media age restriction Australia,"I get it's a little ""entertaining"" and social media hypes it up but why can't other teens see how stupid school fights are","I say this as a guy who used to have anger issues but nowadays wouldn't hit someone back if they punched me in the face, not because I'm weak but bc I've learned from past mistakes that being ""soft"" is best sometimes. There are all sorts of risks that come with fighting, especially when you're fighting someone who's determined to hurt you without thinking about consequences or ""rules"" to hold em back whilst you're both on a concrete surface. I know it's been going on before social media but I feel all the recording even motivates people to go a step further and it's all for nothing, someone says a couple words or you have different opinions and now you're trying to pull moves that could cause brain damage or sometimes even death on em? Some people my age need to realise they're not in a Bruce Lee edit and all sorts of horrible things could happen if it goes wrong, none of which you'll think to yourself (if they happen) ""well at least I hurt the guy talking shit about me"". This is just kind of a rant so feel free to ignore it but I'm so sick of ""school fight"" culture, no I'm not fighting someone over a couple words 🤦🏾‍♂️. The ""self defense"" shit is a joke, if a dude sucker punched you it's fine to fight back because they'll obviously hit you again even if you don't but most ""self defense"" is just blown out of proportion, I've seen multiple vids of people doing all sorts of dangerous shit that goes beyond actual self defense and a lot of the times the option to run away/not hit back is available but rather than run you wanna be a badass thinking you're ultra instinct Bruce Lee.

Reddit and youtube are the only social media I use (WhatsApp doesn't count)

I don't have much experience with other social medias, but I agree.

I mean, Reddit is decent cause sometimes I do business on here, but in my opinion, I feel like TikTok is the best social media app in the world because it’s the most popular social media app because you will never see any other social media app that has over 1 trillion hashtags used also it’s not really branded unless you get on that side of the For You page cause most of my for you page is like cooking or singing or car videos and then it quotes and rants and it’s also good for news. I was literally in the store watching people panic by a tissue and water and I was watching the video of this one lady she’s called the news girlie, and she said the strike ended on the second day and I was just standing there watching everybody waste money on tissue and water. I already knew it was gonna happen though because last time they said we’re quarantined nobody was quarantined and everybody wasted money on tissue and water. It was just so funny to see everybody fall for that dumb stuff again.😂

teenagers,online safety for teenagers,[19m] birthday's coming up tomorrow. offering you my ancient life tips before i go :>,"tomorrow (the 15th of january) marks my birthday and i am officially turning 20, leaving the teen life for good. yikes. i didn't even order a coffin yet i think i'm running behind on this-

it's already been some time since this subreddit has stopped feeling relatable, or even enjoyable to scroll through for me, but i can still appreciate what it embodies and it reminds me of my own journey through my teens. it's been crazy and not always the best, but despite that i think i am coming out of it in a good position to grow further. reddit has influenced these last couple years of mine more than i thought they would! seriously. and shockingly in pretty good ways.

so i figured you lot deserved a goodbye, even if we don't know each other at all. i've been more of a lurker here than anything else over the years.

=======

i figured i might just leave some of my personal thoughts and tips; and i'm also open for more specific advice you may want!

1 - just don't be scared of being yourself. you may cringe at parts of you looking back, you may regret certain decisions you make, but it all builds up to something better. you'll regret a lot more if you don't let yourself be you, authentically. show your emotions, interests, and thoughts whenever it feels right to you. i know it can be difficult to feel normal or cool, but people aren't looking at you as much as you think, and you are so much more likely to accept and even embrace yourself if you don't inhibit your essence!

2 - especially around this time of life, don't assume malice out of people. the average person isn't a psychopath or straight-up an asshole. conflict arises out of misunderstandings so much more often than malice! and people are more likely to nurture and show their human kindness when you try to create an environment of understanding and empathy. resolve things as calmly as you can. this doesn't mean you can't ever be angry or show your anger, but at least in most situations, calm and understanding will be so much more constructive. the world would be such a better place if we were more human

3 - say yes to experiences and opportunities! it's always good to be careful but god, if you can participate in a contest or scholarship; or if you have friends inviting you for a random hangout; or if you come across a free/interesting museum or event or festival; GO FOR IT! you can win so much out of experience. i know i did. i got a scholarship for an international school i could have never gotten to otherwise, i got to meet people i would have never met had i not \*tried\* to (including on reddit!), and i honestly regret not trying more things throughout my teenage years! \[except hard drugs, cigarettes, or vapes. god don't get into that it's such a waste of your money\]

4 -  DON'T IGNORE POLITICS!!! they can and will come for you, so you better understand what politics entail and how they affect life around you. politics can be a constructive tool for the development of our society and it all comes down to hope, ambition, and education. the world is a scary place, but it can also be so wonderful. don't fall into the narratives of distrust, isolation, and hate, hidden under promises of safety, stability, and nostalgia. we are divided enough as it stands.

5 - maybe an overstated one, but for a good reason - please don't let yourself become dependent on the online lifestyle. god you have so much to do outside of your laptop, but the vastness of the digital world will trap you. i occasionally feel trapped myself, five hours a day on my phone, it's not healthy and there are so many better ways of growing your mind. it's never too late to build better habits :) think of journaling thoughts down, meditating, going out on walks.

i think that makes for a nice set of tips. feel free to leave a silly comment or something. love y'all. sending you a metaphorical piece of my birthday cake",3,2,ciscotheginger,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1i1eju4/19m_birthdays_coming_up_tomorrow_offering_you_my/,2025-01-14 19:42:16,happy early birthday,2025-01-14 19:42:16,True
teenagers,online safety for teenagers,What do teens do these days?,"I'm a teen that does homeschooling so I literally never get out. I left school when I was 11 (5th grade) due to bullying and I never get out much. I've had a total of 3 friends in all the years I've been out of school and none of them have ended well. I currently have 0 friends, and no one I talk to outside of my parents and sister. I've tried online friendships too, but that also fell through. It might totally be a me problem, and that people don't like me much or maybe I'm unintentionally rude, I'm not sure. (I'm not saying this in a self depreciating way, just an observation.) I don't often go to the store with my mom because she either goes after work and then comes home or she goes with my grandmother, who hates me. I've only stepped out of my house twice since the beginning of this year. It's bad I know, but I live in a small town with no third places. I'm always bored and I've picked up a number of hobbies to try and curb my boredom but it seems I've run out of options. I tried joining my towns Scouts, and I lasted 2 years before too many problems came up.

teenagers,kids off social media,Mandatory turning 20 Post.. But with a twist and a lesson,"Alright, obligatory I’m turning 20 filler content: so without further a-do me so old and broken, must ask younger sibling to buy me a cane and suspenders. 

Blah, blah blah, the world has changed so much. Random words go here, back in my day we weren’t as fucked

Random bullshit, about college admissions being easier, people can just walk into college nowadays and be accepted.

Something extremely controversial and political here, such as: me like war, war crimes aren’t crimes if you don’t get caught. 

Alright look if your still hear, 1. You enjoy some good old self-deprecating sarcasms. And 2. Your actually here to read my post; no there’s no TLDR. ( I literally don’t have time.. like I’m running out as I type this) 

My main post here today is to give advice and share some of my own experiences with our generations biggest problem, comparing ourselves to others who aren’t in the same exact position/boat/ situation as us. AKA social media syndrome

 I look at people older and younger than me (like a year between each) and see that some of them have already gotten internships, full time jobs in their dream career fields. Notice how I said Careers fields and not dream job, meaning they’re already working in the field they want to be in, they may not have the exact job or position they want but they’re way ahead of others.
 
I look at those and I have 3 main stages I go through: one is absolute depression and I mean I beat myself up and down the street for a solid 3-7 days. Just going back and forth about in my head (if it isn’t obvious, this is not healthy). Their would vary if they were a year younger or older, essentially older = can tolerate/Convince myself to live with it. Younger = absolute depression.  

One unnecessary example is Jenna Ortega, why? Well I watched Wednesday with my friends back in January, it was an absolute banger for my friend group. After we finished it we searched up the cast list and wow, a lot of us were shocked that she and some other members of the cast were only a few moths to a year older than most of us. Damn, I beat myself up, because my news resolution was to get into acting, and I could think was how much sooner I could have started/tried it out when I was “younger” then maybe I could have been where they are right now: having a full time careee and doing what you love/ what your passion is. 

The second stage of this is reflecting on my own life, and what occurred it my childhood and if someone or something I was comparing myself to was even possible for me at that age and maturity level. I’m autistic, diagnosed with alsergers when I was 3 more or less, and struggled a lot emotionally and physically (motor functionally wise).  This can also be used to help calm you down, like if you wanted to be a major singer or actor but grew up in a city that isn’t close to a major entertainment district for the US it’s LA, it can be hard. And those who do do that thing are a lot closer to that location.

This helps calm me down, as watching interviews, behind-the-scenes footage and other types of video about these childhood actors. Just seeing what conditioning and mental toughness training they go through, I don’t think I could have done it, or would have been in the right mindset to at 5, 8 or 11 years old.

I then look back on my own experiences and accomplishments, like most people (apart from a few neurodivergent and autistic friends) I know didn’t really go through what I did when I was kid, and just seeing how far I’ve come since then has shown me that there’s a lot more waiting out there. I went through my own fair share of mental toughness training, and I think everyone does either forced to or at their own rate develop some level of mental toughness while young. 

One example of mine, was forced friend groups and play dates. And no I don’t mean henagong out with my neighbors I mean my folks signing me up for flfriend making programs, where interaction is forced and they are kids “like you” so you should automatically work or be a “fix” to your: adhd, dyslexia, autism, literally level of neurodivergence where people see you as different and you must be fixed to fall in line.  

I feel like situations similar to mine, where I was younger were the norm. And now that we have social media it can be even more enforced, however we must take into account that we the users are the ones giving others the power to push these norms we may or may not agree with onto us. This also leads into body and eating disorders and other types of phobias and disorders that I don’t have time to list here.

(You get the point right?)

———————————————————————————

The third stage is looking at what’s to come and acknowledging past mistakes. 

For example I feel like I wasted my pandemic break, in my sophomore year of HS. All if did was literally whatch anime, play video games and stay home. While others the same age, learned guitar, got into streaming/content creation based off their circumstances, or got into home improvement via fixing their own shit.  

I think this goes to show that everyone has their own passions and personal projects, I was super into the military during my first two years of highschool, and I went to a military school/boot camp during the summer of my junior year. I was also super into woodworking, that I later found out I didn’t love. 

At the end of the day my turning 20 message: is to be you, especially if your neurodivergent (I know, what your thinking, something along the lines of fuck you or Easy for you to say, sitting there typing it up). And this is my answer to that, if your neurodivergent tevale yourself to the world at your own pace and on your own calendar, take as much or as little time as you need to fully take of the mask we all hide behind. 

This goes for those who consider themselves neurotypical, everyone has their own version of a mask, maybe it’s sucking up or putting on a fake smile in front of your super uptight friends, or those who have already conceived a image of you i their minds where you absolutely have to live up to their requirements/expectations in order for them to say: “Classical XYZ ABC” or in order for them to consider you a friend. 

This is why, once the clock strikes new years, I’m deleting all my social media accounts and just absolutely disconnecting from the world for at least 6 months. I’ll check the replies to this post but after tonight (12/27/23 11:59 pm) I wont be part of this community. (Like I was ever involved in the first place) 

Alright well, it’s been real, long winded and there’s no TLDR so suck it ;) learn something

teenagers,kids off social media,My life so far has been nothing but loneliness.,"I'm 14M and I genuinely feel like I'm all on my own in this world. As if God cursed me with never to be able to experience true companionship. This will just be a huge vent post, so here goes nothing.

First of all, my parents. They are Christian fanatics and they've robbed me of a normal childhood by shoving Christianity up my ass and forcing me to take place in a shit ton of church activities etc. Even now. I've lost all motivation to even speak my heart out because I've tried it multiple times and they just won't budge. They'd always reply with "" just pray to God "" and I'm sick of it, because when I do pray it feels empty and I'm talking to nobody, which could be a byproduct of my resentment for the religion. They've always only given me "" God can do it, believe in him "" but never "" you can do it, we believe in you "". They always forced me to abstain from cartoons as a kid and give half of my cash allowance as an offering to church. They would always pick out what and what I cannot watch, and thus I don't even know any of people's ""childhood youtubers "" because I never grew up with them. I grew up with no fun. Now that I'm a teen, they finally stopped limiting the media I take in, but I will never forgive them for depriving me of a childhood I deserved.

But they always force me to serve at church. My fridays, saturdays, basically every day I don't have school I'm at church doing tasks. I don't even like the kids at church. They have the balls to call themselves christians while all they make are racist and misogyny jokes???

Which brings me to my social life, which is mainly at school. Almost all the guys there are racist, misogynistic, homophobic you name it. Just downright toxic. I fucking hate interacting with them because they'd either be all like "" oh look guys it's the nerd! "". Then almost all the girls are manhating lesbians. Or extremely parasocial with someone, but manhaters either way. In simpler words, the people around me are near unapproachable. 

I was fortunate enough to make friends with three girls, two of them are pretty okay. The other ( let's call her Anne ), was best friends with one of the two ( let's call her Ella ). They seemed to be much closer than me or the other girl, but even then they'd spend more time and give more compliments to the other girl than me. Prior to Anne joining the group, I was pretty okay with the other two girls. We were friendly and they would chuckle at the jokes I would make. But nowadays, I'm the focal point for Anne's depreciating jokes ( she's a severe manhater ) and the other two would just laugh their asses off and not even try to defend me. Two weeks ago I was slapped in the face by Anne and Ella after I made a joke about Anne. It hurt me deeply, and until now it still does, especially because I used to be fine with Ella but now I somehow ended up getting slapped by her. Then a couple of days ago Anne was absent for three days in a row, I found solace in finally being free from Anne's hurtful jokes. But that was immediately taken from me after I saw how much they missed Anne. I couldn't say anything, because I definitely didn't miss her. I fucking hated her. Then I realized... I was jealous of Anne and Ella. 

I want to have a best friend too. I want to be friends with someone who understood me. I want to laugh my ass off with someone too. I wanted to be missed in my absence too. Which leads me to now, I've realized just how lonely I really am. My parents will always lead me right to God, while talking to God won't feel like anything. Now my interactions with my only friends just feel empty. I'm afraid of losing my friends right now, but I feel like it's inevitable, especially next week when Anne comes back to school. It's gonna be the final nail in the coffin for me when I see how tight my friends will embrace her and tell her how much they've missed her knowing damn well I will never experience that.

And when I stop to think about it, maybe people hate me because of me. I have no charisma, I stutter when I speak, and I have no talents. I'm not good at anything, I suck at almost everything that I try to do. I'm the shortest boy in the class and I have no looks either. There's just no redemption for me. 

Despite me being only 14, I already feel like this is my lowest point in life. I have no shoulder to cry to, nor do I have any support on speed dial. I'm all on my own. And I have even been contemplating killing myself with any hopes of reincarnation, like just think how fun my life would be in just within 14 years if I were born a girl with looks, talent and charisma. But no, God seems to just hate me I guess. And he did a great job in creating me, because everyone else probably hates me too, and I also hate myself.

I'm also scared about my future. If I've already wasted 14 years of my youth, I may live with deep regrets later on and end up suffering a dreadful life and maybe even die a lonely death. I'm just scared. I'm scared of Anne returning to school, and I'm scared of how much more I'll get hurt by people like her in the future.",3,3,yukihohoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1at1zdf/my_life_so_far_has_been_nothing_but_loneliness/,2024-02-17 13:28:29,"its not just don't think like this the life is so beautiful you just need out and get your Your journey and your adventures and see the world don't think your alone or no 1 interested in you if you see around you you will find there people want you with him just smile and you will see the life

teenagers,kids off social media,Almost always the African dad/East Asian mum,"

As someone who is Poly-Euro, I’ve noticed this trend on social media where the mixed kids always have either an East Asian mum, African dad, or both. Don’t get me wrong, I do see videos where the roles are reversed, but they’re a minority. But I almost never see videos where the relationship involves someone who’s Middle Eastern, South Asian, Native American, Melanesian, Latino/a, or Polynesian like myself. And when I do, they’re never centred around their relationship or mixed kids, which makes me convinced that the East Asian mum/African dad is just a fet1sh. And I’m talking about the content creators like Alyssa Fluellen, Nika Diwa, Lily Petals, ttoria_xo, Myley/The J family, Selina/billingual.baobao, and that one lady with 20+ kids, who profit off of their kid being mixed .

AskParents,kids off social media,What would you do?,"Our boy is 8 (will be 9 in June);  told us that one of his friend's cousins, who is in grade 5, brought his phone to school and showed them a text he received on Discord, which happened to be a naked man with an ""erection"". My son told us he and his other friends were so surprised and shocked to see the picture. 

Even though I was so not happy with the fact that an older kid chose to show the younger kids that explicit picture, I kept it cool and asked what he thought about it without sounding judgmental. I believe we have established an open communication line with our son where he updates us about everything, and I don't want to scare him away, and I shrugged the topic off. 

My question is, how do we navigate conversations about internet safety, nudity, peer pressures, and exposures to inappropriate content? I know the mom of the older kids, and how do I approach her to keep an eye on online content/chats or inboxes her child is exposed to? (Would this idea make our boy a target for snitching on them?)

Do I send an email to the principal about the incident to suggest ways to help kids be aware of social media usage and content?

That there should be no expectation of privacy when he's old enough for phones. Parents have full access. Anyone sending nude or sexual pictures to a child is a dangerous person. Etc etc.

AskParents,kids off social media,"How do I (19F) handle this ""boy+freedom"" issue with my strict parents?","TL;DR - I want to see a guy and need advice for getting my parents to let me

Disclaimer - Please don't just say ""talk to them, or you're 19, you are an adult, or just be honest"". I am looking for real solutions that will work. And if ""talk to them"" is the given solution, please provide a template that you believe would work. Thank you so much

Background - I am 19F, just finished my first year of college. I am one of 9 kids, ages ranging from 38ish to 16. My parents had their own families before joining to have me and my 16-year-old brother. Since birth I have butted heads with my mom but never asked for much. Communication is NOT open, honest, or flowing in my house. I have never ""had a bf"", never talked about boys, never asked to bring one home, or for them to meet one. I can only remember 5 times when I asked to hang out with my friends. Only been to a friend's house once while under 18. Never been in trouble at school or with the law. Don't drink, do drugs, or hang with the wrong crowd. Used to have my texts monitored with ""no social media"" and asked permission to even go into the backyard. Currently still asking to go visit my grandmother. Always been a good student academically. They pay for my college, car, and stuff. 

Situation - While at college, I used that freedom. I met this guy. He's older. (His age is certainly a factor and a problem for the situation, but I don't want the comments to get bogged down with that situation, so I won't include it.) He was chill, and I enjoyed his company. He came to visit me 3 times while I was at university, going an hour out of his way (it's the DFW Texas metropolitan area) for me. He lives 30 minutes from my house and I want to see him. 

Problem - I don't know how to talk to my parents or what to tell them. Based on the past, that drive might be a bit more than they'd feel comfortable letting me do alone. Especially at night or peak traffic times. I could tell them it's a female friend's house whom they know I hang out with, but the problem would be them wanting to drop me off. Could say it's a male friend, but the same problem as before, plus more. I've never been in a situation of them meeting a male friend (except one night in college with my dad), so I'm unsure of how they'd react, but I'm almost certain they CAN NOT meet him. I don't know what to tell them to have them let me go out there for a few hours. 

Question - What do I do? I am prepared and willing to lie to them and adjust the truth. What should I say to get the outcome I want? What combination of the truth and fabrication do I need to make this work? I am asking parents because you know how they think. Would telling the truth work?

I also had a toxic mom like you and I never told her anything. From about 17-27, I barely told her any information about my life. 


How old is he? I know you already mentioned in the post, but his age is relevant to the point I'm about to make. A mature person will be understanding if you explain the situation and say ""logistically I can't make it work to meet you. Maybe you can come here."" If he has a negative reaction to that, he's not a mature person. A significantly older person who's willing to date a 19 year old is not a mature person and is probably a bad person in other ways as well.


I'm pro lying to your parents when you're an adult and they're being unreasonable and toxic. But is this guy really the one you want to be lying over? If you're going to take the risk of potential fallout from this lie, make sure this guy and this situation is actually worth this effort. If he's 24 and up, he's not. Anybody who's worth this effort would also be willing to accept that you aren't in a healthy environment right now and act accordingly.

You don't want an honest answer, because it is talk to them. 

  
Look at it this way.  Your parents pay for your lifestyle.  It's that worth the rush of since older guy hitting on you?  You parents know that they will be the ones to deal with any consequences, because they are the ones bank rolling your life. 

  
Now, her you are, scrambling for just the right lie, like a child, so you can get your way without paying the price.  See what I mean?  This guy isn't making the effort to plan a weekend, and meet your parents.  He just wants to see if your parents' cash can trickle down to him.  It's a terrible idea

I’ve pulled in **35.9 million impressions** on X over the last year, and guess what I’ve earned?

* $45.59 (Jan 31 – Nov 24, 2023)
* $11.34 (Nov 24 – Feb 2, 2024)
* $13.91 (Feb 2 – Feb 16, 2024)

* $18.49 (Apr 12 – Jul 5, 2024)
* $12.22 (Jul 5 – Aug 30, 2024)

That’s **$115.24** for **35.9 million impressions**. It’s laughable. I can maybe buy a couple of dinners with that. For the amount of time and effort we’re putting in, this is **highway robbery**.

Now, X is switching to paying creators based on engagement with Premium subscribers only. Translation: if your followers aren’t paying for Premium, your content means nothing. So now we’re all just salespeople for X Premium. **Seriously?**

And Meta? They’ve been pushing their Creator Monetization program like it’s some holy grail. The truth is, it’s just a profit-sharing scheme that benefits them more than us.

I completely feel your frustration with how Meta and X handle their creator monetization programs. It’s tough when the platforms that promise to support creators end up benefiting more from our content than we do.

But here’s something many creators overlook—Snapchat. Their Stories and revenue-sharing programs are really underrated. If you build a community and post regularly on Snapchat, you can insert ads in between your stories, which can lead to significant income, much better than what Meta and X are offering.

And for those of you who are really creative, you can also apply for Snapchat Shows—people are making serious bank from them! Shows open a whole new level of engagement with audiences. Plus, while Snapchat Spotlight may only pay around $1000/month, that’s still a decent side income for creators consistently posting.

If anyone’s curious about how to start building and monetizing on Snapchat, feel free to hit me up. I’ve helped creators grow their Snapchat accounts from scratch to 50k followers and beyond, and I know the platform inside out.

The only one I think is too much is the not aloud to leave your bedroom for food drinks. Everything else I do agree on. It might be over kill now but i promise you will be grateful later on. I knew someone that was 17/18 passed there driving test and ended up killing himself and all of his mates that were in her car due to driving dangerously! Social media can absolutely ruin your confidence and put you in so much danger. 

The world is a shitty dangerous place for kids now even for the adults!
---
Are you allowed in friends cars if their parents are driving and she knows them?

Honestly, this is the one that stuck out to me the most, besides boys staying over. It’s easy for new driver to get distracted and they don’t know how to best correct course in an emergency like experienced drivers do. A lot of places have it where new drivers can’t have passengers in the car for certain lengths of time for this exact reason. It really is a safety thing at that point. 1-2 years driving experience isn’t a lot even though it may feel like it is.

I think not being able to hang out with friends on school nights and can’t leave the neighborhood is absurd. If you’re doing well in school and continue to remain doing so… that would feel unreasonable to me too.

AskParents,young people and social media ban,Inappropriate neighborhood kid,"Inappropriate neighborhood kid

I visit my elderly friend in a park near his house, because my friend needs to walk to the park to improve his mobility.

A 10-year old neighborhood kid Jules has been stopping by the park picnic table. Jules seems desperate for attention and I'd say he's on the autism spectrum. I frankly feel sorry for him.

Jules brought his pokemon cards yesterday and I made appreciative noises about them. My friend was ready to leave, so I got up to walk to my car.

Jules followed me as I walked through the park, asking me to play 'truth or dare'. I told him a truth about a time (when I was young) when I mean to my sister, and he asked for a dare.

I dared him to squish fallen apples underfoot on the park path.

And this is where the unfortunate turn comes in.

Jules told me that wasn't a good dare, and that I should dare him to do something extremely troubling.

I told Jules that was inappropriate and he could get in a lot of trouble for doing that, but he was unfazed.

That was my exit line. I got in my car and left.

I was appalled.

Ten is certainly old enough to know what's inappropriate, right?

I don't know his parents and can't imagine how they'd react to a strange man on their doorstep with this news.

Should I just chalk this up to a kid on the spectrum being socially inept?

Is this something CPS might want to get ahead of?

(My friend and I will be scheduling our park visits much earlier in the day before school gets out to avoid Jules.)

Did he say ""make me do something bad"" or did he say something like ""make me kill a puppy"" and you don't want to post the details here? Because if it's the second, you need to tell someone.

This kind of thing is tricky. Best case scenario, you start going to the park earlier and just go on with life. 

Worse case, he mentions it to his parents and next you find yourself hit with charges and a ruined reputation because it’s his word against yours. 

I don’t have the answer but those are the scenarios I would be thinking in my head.

CPS already is has a backlog.  Kids say inappropriate things. Just go to the park earlier. ",2024-09-17 21:01:04,False
AskParents,young people and social media ban,Educational YouTubers?,"Aunt to a 7yo boy and 12yo NB child. After nearly a year of having YouTube banned in the house, I made the mistake of downloading it on the family TV so I could use it to cheaply rent movies to watch. The boy has found it and immediately set into the habit that made us delete it in the first place. Now every day it’s hours of young men wearing headphones screaming over footage of Minecraft. I want very much to break the tv so I don’t have to deal with this anymore. 

Barring the obvious, is there a chance there’s people who do the typical YouTube program but instead of screaming, they’re actually educating their viewers? I’ll deal with Minecraft and Fortnite footage if the kids are learning about history or animals or anything at this point.",3,5,Nekodoshi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskParents/comments/17z5trm/educational_youtubers/,2023-11-19 20:15:55,"Here's a list of my favorite educational YouTubers (that tell the information in an interesting way):

(note: some of these are fairly old channels so some of the videos might have outdated information/references)

\- [VSauce](https://www.youtube.com/@Vsauce) (general, often philosophical, trivia)

\- [Because Science](https://www.youtube.com/@becausescience) (applying real-world science/physics to video game/superhero characters)

\- [CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/@CGPGrey) (very random, very fun trivia: from the origins of the name Tiffany to what the numbers on a runway mean to what a normal day is like for a pirate to the path one must take to become Pope)

\- [Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/@kurzgesagt) (general trivia, often very existential)

\- [Film/Food/Game/Style Theory](https://www.youtube.com/@FoodTheory) (showcases research, experimentation, and critical thinking)

\- [Jill Bearup](https://www.youtube.com/@JillBearup) (dissects film/stage combat and movie armor practicality)

I'm sure there are a lot more channels that are more traditionally educational (like TedEd or NatGeo or something) but I feel like some of these cover really fun/interesting topics that you don't realize you're learning things. Granted, most of it is random trivia type stuff... but it's possible that it could drive interest in a topic enough that somebody would dive deeper.",2023-11-19 20:15:55,False
SocialMedia,Australia under 16 social media ban,Which smarthphone should I buy? Samsing vs Apple,"

Amazon Mexico Prices:

Samsung S24 Ultra 256 - $875 USD

iPhone 15 Plus 128GB – $975 USD

Iphone 16 128GB - $995 USD

I'm buying a phone mainly for recording videos for YouTube (I’ll get an external SSD, so storage isn’t an issue) and managing my social media. All my videos will be edited before uploading.

Is there a big difference in video camera quality? Or is there a specific feature that would make one of these a better choice for my needs?

I’ll be editing my videos on a Mac Mini M4—does that make a difference in my choice?

The S24 Ultra looks appealing because of its lower price and great features, but maybe the iPhone 15 Plus is just as good and integrates better with the Mac Mini.

What do you think?

I have the Samsung s24.  It's a great phone.

Samsung videos are recorded as .mp4.  This format can be easily used on all devices, such as computers, and still retain its original quality.

IPhone videos are recorded as .mov.  This format is only used by Apple.  If you move a .mov video to a computer running Windows or upload it somewhere like Google Drive, you may have a loss of quality.  It's best to keep .mov videos within the Apple ecosystem.

I'm personally not a fan of the Apple cult. There is a guy, Robert Mudrak, who used to stream at night on Fridays and Saturdays on TikTok on the Broadway strip in Nashville who swears by the S23 ultra for it's lowlight performance. He said he was going to get the S24 as well, but I don't know if he ever did. The only problem I ever saw watching his lives on the S23 Ultra was going to crowded areas. The connection would tend to drop because too many people would be on the same cell tower. Of course, you might experience this on an Apple device as well. I've used Samsung's personally and this would happen on 42nd ST in NYC at Bryant Park (not using TikTok for live streaming tho). That may be provider specific.

Media storage on an android will be easier to manage and you will not get annoying messages that you're running out of space. Of course you have to be cognizant of how much space you have, but there are tools to help you manage. One tool I recommend is Total Commander. It's based off of the old Norton Commander with 2 file windows side by side (swipable as only one window shows up on screen at a time). It also supports wifi connections with a free downloadable plugin. Of course, you need to understand windows networking for its use.

  
ETA:

Windows supports Samsung phones plugged directly into the computer via a usb cable. You may need to run the Samsung driver though, which is freely available from Samsung. It shows up as a device. Just make sure the phone is unlocked before attempting to do any file operations.

  
Apple devices require special software that you have to purchase separately.

I am a long time samsung lover....except for 2016 when they really messed up and I need to got an iphone.

I swithced to iphone again this year from S23U. The build quality feels disappoited. Mine's metal frame got damaged somhow within a UAG case...which never happens on previous phones. Also there is an annoying problem that dust will be stuck in the buttons and it becomes un-clicky. After seeing the new galaxy watch and buds 3 I decided to switched to apple.

It works very well, now I also have a MBP for photo and video editing.

I have iPhone and I hate it. I upgrade it yearly and nothing ever gets better. In fact my most recent upgrade to the 15 im pretty sure it was just the same darn phone! I wanted to go to Samsung like my husband but bc I have so many apple products I ended up staying. Next phone upgrade I’m actually done with apple! My husband has whatever the newest best Samsung they have is and it has way more features than the newest iPhone on the market (I have). I was so mad at Christmas bc he can change his phones theme. And he had a Xmas theme that decked out the whole phone in Xmas and even did Xmas ringtones!! Just from this one setting. Yea iPhone doesn’t even do that. Oh and iPhone constantly charges my credit card for weird $4.99 “iTunes” purchases but I don’t have iTunes and this isn’t anything I’ve ever been able to account for. When I call apple they just reverse it for me but tbh it’s worth the $5 not to have to call their support.",2025-02-09 16:08:00,False
AskParents,young people and social media ban,Social media?,"Hi,

I have a 12 year old daughter who has a phone for walking to and from school. We allowed her to have certain friends numbers and WhatsApp. We also have it linked to our Google accounts so we can monitor and block sites on her phone. We have not allowed any social media sites. This is due to online safety and the fact that she is legally underage as most site require you to be 13. I must also explain that our daughter has a learning disability that does not allow her to perceive dangers very well. We thought we was doing well with it, we've sat down and explained why we don't want her to have these accounts and the dangers of having them, we've watched certain documentaries with her to try and help her understand. Recently we've found her sneaking these apps and creating accounts. She's been speaking to people we and her do not know. We stopped it straight away deleted the accounts and sat down and spoke with her regarding the dangers. A week later she did it again, we asked her why and she said its because she doesn't think those things will happen to her even though she is still trying to speak to people she doesn't know. It went to point where she snuck into our room and used my old phone to do it. Does any one have any advice or is anyone having the same battle about social media? We've removed all technology at the moment but this isn't practical in the long run. We've tried talking to her about online safety but I think due to her disability it isn't sinking in.

Just for going to and from school?

Maybe use two way radios instead. That's what I've done for my son. Same reasoning. He doesn't need a phone. He's a kid.
