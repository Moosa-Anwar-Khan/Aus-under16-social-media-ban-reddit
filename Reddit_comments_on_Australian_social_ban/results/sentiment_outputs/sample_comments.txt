- It's a spectrum. Don't be scared. You will manage. Plans change. See where it takes you. Life is not about achieving goals, about having picture perfect this or that to impress the neighbours. 
The value of a person doesn't get defined by their achievements, neither yours, nor the kid's. 

Things will be fine, and different.

You can't change the cards you have been dealt, but you can change what you do with them. Maybe not play cards at all, but build a beautiful mobile, cut out a star, whatever from the card board.

Be open and understand that your expectations are yours, and they can change. Life is not about achieving things.

The diagnose doesn't change anything about who your sister is. 

She is going to do things on her own timeline, and when she's in her 20s it isn't going to matter if she learned to talk at 2 or 5. It's great that she's starting to talk and can say 'air' for 'hair' - that's fabulous progress! It's also typical for kids to mispronounce words or drop a letter, whether they have DS or not.

The most important thing here is not to compare her to other kids. You probably didn't like it when you were compared to a sibling or cousin, because you're your own person. So is your sister. Just look at each moment she succeeds at and be happy at her progress. 

I will say, having a child with disabilities can be a true gift. Be extra proud of your sister every time she accomplishes something, because she has to work that much harder at it.

Lastly, I'll leave you with an image. It's called The Fairy of Pure Joy, by Brian Froud.

It might help to remember that a diagnosis is just some new information you have now, nothing has changed about your sister. She is exactly who she was before you knew.  You just understand her challenges a bit more now. It sounds like she is growing up surrounded by love and support, and that gives her the best chance. People grow on their own timelines. 

If she's struggling with speech, you might want to look into getting her an AAC device. Even kids who are very verbal can sometimes benefit from them, it's just another way to communicate. My son is autistic, and although he was an early talker and had a huge vocabulary at 4, he sometimes used a speech program on his tablet. Sometimes he just couldn't access the words, but the thoughts were still there. I'm sure your sister has thoughts she wishes she could express too

People with Down's syndrome have a much better quality of life than they did years ago.  It all depends on the severity and how they're raised.

If your sister is 4 and only just diagnosed, she must be have very mild down's.

In my country, the uk, many adults with Down's have jobs, get married, can drive, all of the things that a person born without Down's can do.

There's even a young actor who has a regular part in a drama called "Call The Midwife", the lad who plays Reggie has been in the series for about 6 yrs now. He's also not the only actor with Down's on the tv.

Just keep on treating your sister like you always have, and the sky's the limit for her.

My son is almost 4 and doesn’t speak.  He uses an app called “Proloquo” to communicate.  The most important thing you need to remember is just because she doesn’t speak, that doesn’t mean she doesn’t have feelings. Never exclude her from a conversation.  Mainly, just love and support her.  She’s still the same person she was before the diagnosis.
- Have you actually had a serious sit down conversation about this? Does she know how you feel?
---
On the mornings she's in bed till 10 and on her phone till 11 do you just leave her to do it? Have you told her how you're starting to feel? 
If it was me and my partner and I was up at 6, I'd be getting my little one to go wake up my partner by 9. 
Start just doing things like when she is awake and doom scrolling say "hey, I'm going to go paint, the kiddos been fed so you just keep an eye on him. Thanks" Then go paint. Maybe I'm wrong, but it sounds like you are just quietly taking the roll of the default parent and not letting her know how alone you feel in it. 
She might cry and get upset, but she needs to hear it.
Is she possibly depressed? She went back to smoking, and doom scrolling can often be something people do to avoid how they are feeling.

Oh brother!! 
I have a near two year old as well and my last of 4, was super clingy. It was a task but was able to break that but I did and she loves exploring the house on her own when her siblings are off to school. Bond with your kid and get him involved in your hobbies too. I take my kids to soccer and they watch me play and opposing teams are jealous of my team's fanbase(my kids: 7,5 and 2). I know it's easy to accept someone for who they are but when you need them to step up, that's how you know you were never really cool with it, it just didn't affect you then. With time, you'll take off that pressure and continue loving your wife like you always did. Continue having conversations with her how you feel. The waterworks will come but choose feel good moments to bring up burning issues.
---
I don't understand why your tiptoeing around her and why her water works would scare.  This is the universe trying to get you to stand up for yourself who gives a s*** if she gets mad tell her how you feel and that is that. 
---
When you talk to her do you speak in terms of what *you* need versus what she’s doing “wrong”? 

“I’d like to be able to work on my hobby Saturday mornings. What’s a time we can agree on for me to do that?” 

Because it sounds like you’re not mad that she’s taking alone time, it’s that you also want alone time. So maybe tell her what it is you need and figure out what that looks like and how she can help you accomplish that. Everyone is more likely to help someone out than they are being accused of something.
- Your parents did the right thing. Regarding a parent's ability to check their kid's DM: what would we think if a husband could check his wife's DMs for her safety without her having the possibility to say no? Everyone would call it a red flag!

In both cases, I believe that the person should have a right to veto, yet private messages are called private for a reason!
Regardless of all of this, youth liberation would mean that predators would have a harder time finding victims.

If a teen (13+) wants private use of social media, there shouldn't be any blanket policy against it. A parent wanting to oversee the youth's account should submit a request to the account holder, who should be free to deny or approve the request. If a parent attempts to coerce an unwilling youth into allowing such access, the youth should be able to report the parent to the site for possible investigation.

something like "safety net" would be pretty good name imo
- He was heckling a retail worker for his own amusement.   If it was really about putting a smile on the other guy's face, he would have approached with more compassion. You're not wrong to be annoyed by his behavior. 

This reminds me of all the shitty "joke" responses I used to get working retail for just doing my job.
---
It wasn't from a kind place, that's why you're annoyed. 

Your dad admitted it when he said he should be grateful to have a job and be smiling. 

It wasn't about the worker ACTUALLY feeling good. It was about calling out the worker for not having a grin and faking it for your dad's comfort. Your dad was not just calling them out, but putting them in their place. It was dehumanizing. 

All 3 of you knew what it was, your dad is from a different generation where it's okay to put staff in their place. We are from the generation that accepts that retail is hard and not every worker will be grinning and happy to serve at all times at the local Walmart.

So, as someone who has checked receipts at another large warehouse store....it's annoying af when people "joke around" and "try to put a smile" on my face. Please just hand me the receipt and go on your way. Obviously, it's fine to be nice, and if a joke organically happens, it's totally cool. But the people who try to mess around or tell me to smile are usually the worst. I'm just trying to do my job, I'm sure you're not all smiles at work either, buddy. 

It's not really a big deal in the long run, but it is annoying, and I *will* roll my eyes after they leave. That's my two cents, at least. I say, good on you for saying something, but he won't change, and it's fine. Just walk ahead or behind him if it bothers you lol
---
I've befriended the receipt checker at my local Walmart. 

He is struggling greatly with medical and familial problems. 

He's the nicest dude on the planet, I'm convinced. He doesn't always smile, because he is constantly suffering and he's a human being. 

Sometimes little jokes are okay, but you never know how the joke will be received. 

I've found that just being nice and friendly with everyone is the best way to be. 

I constantly compliment strangers if I like their shirt or whatnot. I do this with men and women alike.  Sometimes it takes people aback momentarily, but they quickly realize I'm just passing by and complimenting them. That's when they usually say, "Thanks!" as I walk on. Sometimes they will talk to me for a bit. 

I've made actual friends / lovers like this multiple times over my 45 years of existence. Just by being kind and friendly. 

It's weird. Being nice and not having ulterior motives goes a long way!

I hate people that do this.  People that do this in food service are the worst. "I don't want that!!!" Or "your paying for this right?" When you give them the check.

- This isn't the right place to post attack ads for local school board races.  Very, very few people here are going to vote in your local school board election.
- Thank god, a sane study.  

Blaming social media for ruining teens is some boomer shit.  And it is classic scapegoating -- like blaming video games, or vaping, or porn, or rock and roll music, or jazz.  You blame something innocent to distract attention from the real things that are causing harm -- parents, schools, capitalism.
---
Adults treat kids like shit and then when kids are sad they go “it must be the phones!”
---
The planet is literally being destroying by a violent unsustainable system of privilege and oppression...

And so the system wants to blame a messenger (ie. social media). This is very typical.
---
Lots of things are symptoms. The root cause is capitalism. Or of you wanna go deeper, it's imperialism.

What defeats both things, is also the direct cure for youths: community building and solidarity.

The way to get those is to demand fixes to urban planning, or just take control of urban spaces. Way less cars, way more middle density and public spaces (ie. Parks and libraries).

- It's "think of the children", but never:

- Think of the homeless children
- Think of the children in underfunded public schools
- Think of the children born into poverty

It just amazes me the *speed* with which they rammed this bill through. Shows they're capable of efficiency when it suits them.
---
I see the problem differently. To me it's not about government overreach, it's about the refusal of successive governments to actually govern, and allowing systemic problems to take root so deeply that they become very difficult to regulate, leading to extreme "emergency" band aids, like the social media ban, and absolute failures like the housing crisis. 

If we, as voters, thoughtfully engaged with politics we might have not let the social contract become so broken, but here we are. Broken media, broken healthcare, broken education, housing crisis, cost of living crisis, pathetic populist politicians and culture war after culture war distracting us from working together to fix things.

Just saw a post on ABC Insta that was a story about how access to paracetamol could be adjusted as there are teenagers who are using it to self harm via overdose.

I audibly groaned. While of course teen mental health is important, we do not need stronger laws preventing casual purchases of bloody paracetamol!! We need better mental health care and awareness in general.
---
Since forever? Protecting children is like the go-to to pass unpopular laws. It's been like that for a long time. There's a reason why "won't somebody think of the children" was satirised in the simpsons.

That and terrorists too to pass unpopular laws
- Dont care about u16 banned from social media.

Do care about handing my ID to social media companies. I won't be doing this. 

The risk of ID theft via hack/exposure is too high and I'm not prepared for my ID to be linked to my social media accounts.
---
I think the main concern we should have is the privacy concerns. 

Also, how is this going to work? If we are submitting a govID, then how will this work for non-australian residents? Will the myGov ID work with foreigners too. What will happen to tourists who visit Australia? What will happen to their account if they try to access it while over here? If we are not uploading any form of ID, then what are the privacy implications of training AI to do age detection
---
I very much care that they passed through a blank cheque with a trust me bro and ignored an extreme amount of feedback to appeal to a newscorp change.org

In the senate some restrictions to not allow abuse of this were proposed and struct down by the 2 major parties.

It's not the face value you should care about.
---
Yeah I won't ever be exposing my ID online. Even a government dept accidentally exposed my ID to others when they made me send it online.

I was thinking, You can get onto porn sites with simply clicking yes I’m 18. How can a social media site be more regulated than an R18 site?

Restrictions alone won’t solve this. Locking down her phone, cutting off social media, and assigning her sister to watch over her may temporarily plug the holes, but they’re band-aids on a much bigger wound.

What you’re facing here is not just rebellious behavior; it’s a young person screaming for control, independence, and…dare I say it…validation, albeit in some very risky ways. Her sneaking out and seeking out significantly older men isn’t just about bad choices. It’s about trying to fill a need for attention or connection that, for some reason, isn’t being met in healthier ways.

The tough reality? You can’t control her every move. She’ll find ways around your lockdowns, and she’ll lie, as you’ve already seen. You have to address the why behind this behavior…what’s going on inside her head, and why is she seeking out this level of risk?

Here’s what you can do:

Stop playing the jailer and start being the investigator. Instead of locking everything down tighter, open up more conversations that are actually about her. Don’t just lecture her about consequences…she knows those by now. Ask her what’s going on inside her, who she’s looking for validation from, and why.

Get real about trust. Right now, you and she are locked in a trust war. If you double down on punishment without a relationship reset, you’re going to lose. You need to let her know she has some agency in rebuilding the trust she’s broken, but it starts with her opening up, too.

Therapy, therapy, therapy. You can’t tackle this alone. She needs a professional to help her process whatever emotional void is driving this behavior. Family game nights are nice, but they don’t unpack deep-seated issues of self-worth, rebellion, or dangerous choices.

Let her feel the weight of real consequences. Not just your consequences…because those can feel arbitrary…but the actual dangers she’s putting herself in. Maybe that means bringing in someone who can speak to the real risks of vaping or sleeping with older men…someone outside the family who can make these risks feel tangible, not like a distant lecture from mom.

You love her; that’s obvious. But love also means facing that you can’t control her into safety…you have to guide her into it, even when she’s making choices that scare you.

Also please educate her on HPV > Oral Cancer, STIs, etc.

birth control asap

If the significantly older guy was 18+, please consider contacting police for statutory rape.      When i was 15/16 I was so lost.  I was groomed by a man 10 yrs older.     I was the typical stupid "look how mature I am that I attracted much older men".    My parents did nothing.    Men who use girls this age tend to be men who want to control,  use, and abuse.    Do whatever you have to scare those nasty predatory men away.  

I recommend getting her into therapy.   A lot of the draw to sex for girls this age is the validation.     The drug use is self medication.    Address the why she's doing both rather than trying to control the behavior with punish.    You probably should do both solo and family counseling. Family counseling can improve the relationship she has with you two and give you specific ideas on how to respond to her poor choices.   If wait list for solo counseling is crazy long, consider driving outside your area or doing telemedicne .   

Make it harder for her to sneak out without anyone noticing.  A door alarm or a Ring type camera could notify you and your spouse anytime there's someone coming or going.
