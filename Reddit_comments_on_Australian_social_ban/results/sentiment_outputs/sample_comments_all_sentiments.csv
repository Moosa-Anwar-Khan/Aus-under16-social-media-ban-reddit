australia,"I want a ban on the gambling ads

Bought to you by the same party as the famed internet filter!

What the fuck are we doing guys?

You won't ban gambling ads but will the thing that many young kids like to do with their mates for fun.

Can’t ban Sportsbet but we can ban kids off TikTok.

Good work.

I would say the age restriction for social media and internet in general should be at least 13 years, which it mostly is already, but nobody could actually enforce this law no matter the age, so it doesn't truly matter.

Not really possible to enforce in private settings, pretty sure it's just a scare tactic more than anything

I’ve noticed masks are a lot more common than prior to the pandemic
---
Can we normalise staying home when sick? 

I get you have to go out for meds, and possibly grocery. But we need to make it easier for casual workers to be able to stay home when sick.
---
I wore a mask on Thursday because I had a head cold and one of my co-workers has a parent in hospital in intensive care and another has an immuno-compromised kid.

I had four or five people from other areas on the floor stop me and ask if I had COVID, who mostly then looked at me like I was being a weirdo or drama-queen when I said no, but I didn't want to spread my cold. A couple of them were definitely seemed like they were ""offended"" by the mask, but in fairness a couple of others also said that made sense etc. whatever. People have a lot of residual weirdness/angst about that whole period, so I get some would feel a reaction, but as you say, it should just be common courtesy.

Young lady at my Supermarket wears a mask constantly. I asked her one day if she was sick and replied 'No, and I  don't want to be. The people that cough in my face have other ideas though'

Parenting,"I think that kids your sons age are trying to figure out their sexuality, they're trying to figure out themselves and these (relatively) new urges that they have, they're trying to figure out where they fit into the world, and they're trying to find a group to belong to.  I think those things can cause some kids who aren't really trans to decide ""you know, this feels right to me, I think this is my place in the world"" for awhile.  In short, it's a phase.  Not always of course, but for some kids.  Whether that's the case for your son I don't know.

Whether your son is genuinely trans or not I think the next step is the same.  Find a therapist.  If he genuinely is trans that's who will be able to help him start making a plan to transition.  And if it is just a phase the therapist will help him work through those feelings and realize that medically transitioning isn't right for him.  I definitely wouldn't try to talk him out of anything.  He's pretty much at the peak rebelliousness age.  Trying to convince him it's just a phase is going to lead to him pushing back harder than he would if you are outwardly supportive.
---
As someone with a trans child, who had a hard time of it internally, here is my advice:

1) Accept that it might be real and it might be a phase. It could be either, so accept that and let it unfold. Fighting it will not benefit you or your child. It will only cause their feelings to become further entrenched. Trying to force your child from friends will only make those friends more attractive. Same with activities.


2) Accept your child. Period. No conditions. If your child wants to be called them, do it. If your child wants to be called him or her, do it. This sends a message to your children that they are safe to explore and they are accepted by their parents no matter what. Accept them no matter what. Make yourself safe to your child. Allow your child to feel safe telling you how they feel. Express that they are safe.


3) Get your child therapy. It will help your child figure themselves out and understand themselves. Either they will be able to come to terms with who they are and navigate the difficulties of being trans, or they will learn about boundaries and not be who their friends want them to be. But either way, it will help them.


4) Get yourself therapy. You need to process this without it affecting your child. Accepting that your child is not who you planned them to be takes work. Do the work. 


5) Read. Learn about what it means to be trans and how to be a parent to a trans child. There is a lot of material out there. Take advantage of that.


6) If your child comes out to you, seek out help from your local gender clinic. They have resources to help your child and you. It is not necessarily about hormones or surgery (and may never be). It will be helpful for mental health.


Please feel free to contact me if you need more support.

I didn’t read this whole thing but unfiltered access to the internet isn’t a great idea before 16 at the youngest. I’d reevaluate that. Anxious generation is a great book.

Hi there! Trans person here! 

Listen, you are right that this may be hard for your kid. I get that you are scared for them, that makes total sense - the world is a little scary for us right now. I get that this is a lot for you to adjust to, and that it can be hard to accept this new identity when it seems to have come out of nowhere. 

But - you are going to be ok. You are a good parent. I can tell because your kid felt safe enough to come out to you. Your kid is processing a lot of big identity stuff and they told you about it, even though they are a teenager and naturally separating from you in a lot of ways. 

So take a deep breath and give yourself a hug. Your teen trusts you with this and that is huge. 

Now just support them. They might be trans, they might not. Being a teenager is about figuring yourself out. But you lose nothing by just believing them right now. If they change their mind later that is ok. Just be there for them and listen. Don’t try to talk them out of anything, just listen and see where they are coming from. 

Trans youth face a high risk of suicide - and that risk is more than cut in half when they have a supportive parent. 

Being trans is not a choice. But telling you was a choice. Please make the choice to support your kid in return.",Positive

I don’t want to get overly technical but fuck those kids and, yes, escalate it.
---
There's a school in my state being sued by the parents of a girl who did kill herself after a campaign of harassment like this.

The parents claim the school did nothing and swept it under the rug. 

I'd take them up on their offer to escalate it and be glad they're willing to be proactive rather than chalking it up to ""kids being kids"".
---
Let the school escalate it. That kind of behavior needs to be halted, with whatever punishments the resource officer deems necessary.
---
I would just like too add, if you choose to go against your daughter's wishes to ""just drop it"" (and i believe you should push this for the record) make sure you're sitting her down and explaining what you're planning on doing and what it'll look like moving forward and WHY it is important to push this. Teaching children to defend themselves is important. I struggle with this in my adult life now, becuase I didn't learn this skill in childhood. 

I am very confident she will say something like ""pushing this will make things worse for her"" or ""no one will want to be her friend"" and it's vital she understands that this won't stop at all unless it's forced and they see there are consequences for such terrible behavior. And these people were never her friends because friends don't treat others this way. 

Also also, i know you didn't want phone comments but if I may just suggest a ""no phone when you're home"" policy? If she's getting picked on at school and then comes home and gets it on her phone too she gets zero decompression time. It's probably very taxing on her. 

I hope this works out for you guys and im sorry you're going through this!",Negative
privacy,"[With the utmost respect to this sub’s community]

People are simply tired and apathy has fully set in. They no longer trust the companies they were once told they could rely on, because time and again those companies have shown they don’t truly care about customers’ and users’ data. Whether it’s failing to put proper safeguards in place (leading to breaches) or blatantly selling and trading data with third parties, these organizations have undermined public confidence.

As a result, many people feel their information is already “out there,” so urging them to protect it seems pointless. Growing distrust in the government only adds to this sense of resignation. In their view, they have nothing left to lose. They’re not all cybersecurity experts or analysts; they don’t see the risks we deal with day in and day out, and they’re certainly not privacy wonks. For them, it’s just another reason to tune out and give up on the idea of real data protection.

I don’t have any answers, and this is just one person‘s opinion, but, yeah.
---
People would love to care, I think it’s unfair to frame the issue this way. The problem is people know all their info and countless hours of their browsing data has already been bought, sold, and stolen countless times, in some cases including by China. How can you expect people to care when they receive mail at least once a year telling them about a data breach at some company they didn’t even know had it? When they have evidence of their phones listening to them despite companies denying it? When the personal info of *every person who’s ever filled out an SF86* was stolen by China due to the government’s shitty cybersecurity infrastructure?

People are tired. They feel privacy is an outdated concept, and honestly they’re probably right. Our government has shown people that our data security isn’t a priority, they have done *nothing* to protect us in that regard, but they expect us to take it seriously?
---
The use of rednote is in protest against banning tiktok. It's not because they're sending data to the chinese on purpose, although that may well also be the case here. 
---
There's a certain irony to people flocking to an app that is - allegedly - more closely linked with the Chinese government than TikTok, in order to avoid a theoretical ban based on TikTok allegedly being too close to the Chinese government.

australia,"Our society was not built for single people, so even though I am a single male who is paying off a mortgage, it’s getting tighter and tighter. The thought of having to go to the renters market scares me. The single income, even if you above “minimum” wage doesn’t get you far at all. The fact that you can work a 40 hour week and still barely scrape by is criminal to me. You should be able to cover your living expenses, while have a bit extra to save and have some nice things (nice, not extravagant).
---
Remember that many voters actively want housing to be very expensive...
---
I am so sorry this has happened to you. I am terrified of it happening to me. Renting just sucks so much.
---
The whole process is shit. Literally every part of the process is focused on maximising monetary gain, as opposed to being a balance between monetary gain and getting people into homes.
It’s actually quite disgusting we’ve let it get this bad, but imo Australians are always very keen to line their pockets and jump on lucrative opportunities, even when it’s at the expense of the community they reside in.
A major overhaul is needed to re-balance the owner/renter system, even basic temporary measures like rent freezes or caps aren’t implemented. 
A major overhaul will never occur because people are simply too selfish to give up a cent of even potential income and only a third of the population rent.
Ultimately, without taking drastic steps to address this crisis Australia will devolve into a dual class society within 10-20 years, renters and owners. Every trend points towards this.

I’ve been at my rental for over five years and I’m terrified if my landlord wants to sell.

I recently watched a film from the 90s about the experiences of Aboriginal people on Flinders Island. An old lady was explaining that her mother told her to say she was Māori instead of Aboriginal so she wouldn’t get abused/picked on/discriminated. 

I thought that kind of racism had gone away until I started to read a few community Facebook comment sections.
---
I haven't noticed any animosity first hand but I do know that when people's basic needs aren't being met (food, shelter, healthcare etc) it's a lot harder to feel open and understanding to others when they may feel (rightly or wrongly) that another group is getting preferential treatment. This housing crisis and cost of living crisis and mental health crisis... it's all piling up, making it harder and harder to be as kind to others as we should when our only priority is keeping our heads above water. As usual, the only real divide we should be concerned with is that between the haves and have nots. Tax the rich, solve wealth inequality and the rest of our divisions (like racism) become much less insurmountable.
---
I live in FNQ, and the amount of racism I see on Facebook is absolutely disgusting. I have an Aboriginal friend who has said they worry about discrimination/racism just asking questions to a staff member of a restaurant or store as well as a family friend who herself is white, but worries about her Aboriginal children being attacked on the street. Racist people have always (and will always) exist, but I think the media and a general lack of education play a huge part in it.
---
I think the reason is twofold 

1. What some view as constant anti-Australian propaganda being pushed by loud voices on the left (Australia is illegitimate, colonisation was a totally bad thing with zero positives, the welcome to country and acknowledgement to country stuff in tons of contexts where to some people it feels very annoying).

2. Indigenous people are massively overrepresented in crime. This is a fact. In towns where they have a big presence (Cairns, Darwin, Townsville) they commit ALOT of property crime, assaults, etc. The common perception is that they get away with being given bail and then light sentences, especially juveniles. People are already doing it tough financially. Add incessant break ins and attempted break ins and it isn't hard to see why tensions are boiling over. 

I tried to be objective there and just present facts. I do have sympathy for the plight of indigenous Australians but it's also a fact that they are hugely overrepresented amongst the criminals, substance abusers and generational welfare recipients.",Negative

I had a friend who lived in a different country to me. We spoke every day for four years and then one day he just....vanished. I don't know if he ghosted me or if something happened but I had no way of finding out. It was awful. I grieved but also felt strangely angry and guilty at the same time. I didn't know what to feel. We were so close and he just disappeared. To this day I don't know if I'm more worried about him or angry at him.

Yep. I’m the one that’s dropped off, and I’ve had it happen to me. I was bullied at work for about 18 months and had to walk out of my job. I’m trying to pick up the pieces and I’ve completely cut communication with most people. I get insanely stressed when I receive messages from people and can’t bring myself to check them. It’s just too overwhelming. I even shut off reddit for the past couple of weeks because I had a bunch of notifications. 


Sometimes people need space to “digest” life and pick themselves back up. Sometimes people need distance from people who make them feel like crap and people that are only fair weather friends. I have “friends” who can’t/won’t offer an ear or support when you tell them what’s going on, but they’ll expect you to drop absolutely everything for them if they’re going through a hard time. Also I have friends that mean well, but when they try to show empathy it just ends up being shown in a way that makes you feel pathetic and much worse about yourself and your predicament; it could be their tone of voice, or those utterly useless sayings like “oh well it could be worse” before trying to convince you their life is worse than yours.

Yes. Bloke that shared trips to Bathurst, beach holidays, etc. He won the lottery back in the 70’s. The amount would be multimillions in today’s money. After a year or so of certain folk chasing him for money, he simply disappeared. I was reasonably close, but even his best friend from school days has no idea where he went. Neither of us ever asked him for money.
